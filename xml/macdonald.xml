<l>Striding the deep-sea dykes fast home they fare,-</l>
<l>Where is my wedded love? Where is my boy?</l>
<l>Where go the dead that died for England, where ?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Homeward the long ships leap; but not with these</l>
<l>Thy boy, thy wedded love, O gentle-eyed</l>
<l>Woman of England, nor far over-seas</l>
<l>Mixing with dull earth sleep the dead that died</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>For England. They, in God's completed aims,</l>
<l>Bear each his part; unseen of bounded sight,</l>
<l>Down the vast firmament that floats and flames</l>
<l>Crested with stars and panoplied in light,</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Of strenuous clean souls a long array</l>
<l>With lambent lance and white, bright, blinding sword,</l>
<l>All riding upon horses-what are they?</l>
<l>They are the dead which died in Christ their Lord</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>For England, from old time; with God made one,</l>
<l>As on the mount the triple vision shone,</l>
<l>So shine they now, and like the noontide sun</l>
<l>Before them all the fair St. George rides on.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>There goes the boy of Cr&#x00E9;cy, whispering low</l>
<l>To him of Agincourt, a kingly pair,</l>
<l>With many mighty men which bent the bow-</l>
<l>There go the dead that died for England, there;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>There go those quenchiess Talbots, there theflower</l>
<l>Of Devon, Grenville, Gilbert, mariners rare,</l>
<l>She too who thought foul scorn of Philip's power,-</l>
<l>There go the dead that died for England, there;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And Sidney who the rippling cup resigned,</l>
<l>And happy Wolfe; wan Pitt released from care,</l>
<l>Nelson the well-beloved, and all his kind-</l>
<l>There go the dead that died for England, there;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And he who broke the Corsican's strong spell,</l>
<l>And Nicholson impatient of despair,</l>
<l>And Gordon, faithful, desolate sentinel-</l>
<l>There go the dead that died for England, there;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And there unhelmeted, ungirt of brand.</l>
<l>Victoria moves with mild, maternal air,</l>
<l>Still vigilant, still prayerful for the land--</l>
<l>There go the dead that died for England, there;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Nor ride they idly nor with indolent rein,</l>
<l>Irresolute, as men that seek no foe,</l>
<l>But by the pathless sea, by peak and plain</l>
<l>Bright-eyed, stern-lipped, all day, all night they go</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Forth as a fire that snatches and davours</l>
<l>Wind-withered woods, so go they swift and fell,</l>
<l>Warring with principalities and powers,</l>
<l>Hunting through space the swart, old bands of hell</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And all the sounding causeways of the spheres</l>
<l>Ring like white iron with the rhythmic tread</l>
<l>Of these and their innumerable peers;</l>
<l>But most round England muster England's dead,</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Round England cradled in her roaring seas,</l>
<l>With Arctic snows white-girdled, bathed in suns</l>
<l>Asian. and Australasian, there go these;</l>
<l>And where one solitary trader runs</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>His English keel, and where one lonely sword</l>
<l>Glimmers for England, one unsleeping brain</l>
<l>Watches and works for England, thitherward</l>
<l>Gather the bright souls of her servants slain</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>For her, and lock their shimmering ranks, and sweep</l>
<l>Round England's child as sweeps the northerngale</l>
<l>Round some stark pine-tree on the moorland steep,</l>
<l>And from the flash and rattle of their mail</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Hell's pale marauders shudderingly recoil</l>
<l>Frustrate. O glad condition and sublime</l>
<l>Of our undying dead, to fight and foil</l>
<l>The ancient foe, continually to climb</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Through God's high order of His saints, to meet</l>
<l>Some soul whose star-like name lit all theircourse,</l>
<l>And commune with him, to discern and greet</l>
<l>Old kindred, love, and friendship, hound and horse;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>To see God face to face, and still to see</l>
<l>And labour for the loves that grope on earth,</l>
<l>To wait serenely till all souls shall be</l>
<l>One in God's aristocracy of worth-</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>O glad condition and sublime! whereto</l>
<l>That southern tomb thy hands may never tend</l>
<l>Was but the gateway thy loved boy passed through,</l>
<l>Thy wedded love passed through, that he might wend</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Homeward to thee; thou canst not see the blaze</l>
<l>Of his great blade nor hear his trumpets blare,</l>
<l>Yet thick as brown leaves round about thy ways,</l>
<l>There go the dead that died for England, there.</l>

<l>Dear boys! They shall be young for ever:</l>
<l>The Son of God was once a boy. </l>
<l>They run and leap by a clear river,</l>
<l>And of their youth they have great joy. </l>
<l>God, who made boys so clean and good, </l>
<l>Smiles with the eyes of fatherhood.</l>

<l>Now Heaven is by the young invaded;</l>
<l>Their laughter's in the House of God.</l>
<l>Stainless and simple as He made it</l>
<l>God keeps the heart o' the boy unflawed.</l>
<l>The old wise Saints look on and smile, </l>
<l>They are so young and without guile.</l>

<l>The glory that hath them in keeping</l>

<l>YOU, killed in action, leading men! </l>
<l>I hardly yet believe it true:</l>
<l>For me you're still the boy of ten,</l>
<l>Blue-eyed and curly-haired, I knew.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>You looked so gentle and so mild,</l>
<l>I wondered if you'd play your part,</l>
<l>For schoolboy life is rough : you smiled,</l>
<l>And straightway captured every heart.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>You played your part: you wrote your name</l>
<l>Upon our simple annals clear,</l>
<l>In field and form-room still the same,</l>
<l>A knight without reproach or fear.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>We saw you go from strength to strength,</l>
<l>Your praises loud on every lip,</l>
<l>Until you crowned the whole at length</l>
<l>By leaving with a Scholarship.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The years passed by, and Oxford took</l>
<l>The charge your Public School laid down;</l>
<l>One happy year, and you forsook</l>
<l>For duty called-the magic gown.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Of course you were the first to go: </l>
<l>You never were the sort to shirk.</l>
<l>That was no time for books, and so </l>
<l>You turned to more important work.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And is this all ? Was all in vain</l>
<l>The life that you so early gave? </l>
<l>And only, swept by wind and rain, </l>
<l>Another British soldier's grave?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>We thought that radiant soul was meant </l>
<l>For greater things: we should be sure </l>
<l>o life is short, thus nobly spent, </l>
<l>No hero's death is premature.</l>

<l>God of the love which makes two lives as one,</l>

<l>And think there rests all-hallowed, in each grave,</l>

<l>The music of the Bowl of Gold </l>
<l>Aeolian o'er me, and I knew </l>
<l>That man's inveterate hope was true.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The silver cord is loosed, and broken </l>
<l>The golden bowl: again the dust </l>
<l>Returns to earth." What ruth unspoken </l>
<l>Wells upwards in the words august! </l>
<l>What swell of the heart's bitterness </l>
<l>Heaves underneath their tranquil stress!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>O mourning voice, so vast and tender, </l>
<l>Draping thy requiem as a pall </l>
<l>Of hushed magnificence, a splendour </l>
<l>Dim on the common doom of all, </l>
<l>Thine is indeed a gentle word </l>
<l>For death--the loosened silver cord.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But for the dead thou hast no pan, </l>
<l>No laurel crown, no branch of palm, </l>
<l>Only a threnody lethean </l>
<l>Serene in all-surrendering calm;</l>
<l>And, like a bell that surges toll, </l>
<l>The burden of the Golden Bowl.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet rises up the old misgiving:</l>
<l>Is it song's sorcery that transmutes </l>
<l>To gold the pitcher-sherds which, living, </l>
<l>Were earthier of the earth than brutes ? </l>
<l>Can this be said of such as they, </l>
<l>Poor cruses of coarse-shapen clay?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Gold? So the phrase is, thus miscalling </l>
<l>That swarming life, obscure and null, </l>
<l>Rolled by the river ever falling </l>
<l>Into an ocean never full. </l>
<l>-Drift and drab ooze to floor the sea </l>
<l>Whose waters are eternity.</l>

<l>Before me rose austere, impassive, </l>
<l>A cliff-like scarp of limestone grey. </l>
<l>Lofty it stood, a barrier massive </l>
<l>Athwart the cypress-bordered way; </l>
<l>And on the face of it a gloom </l>
<l>Which seemed a cavern or a tomb.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And sculptured shapes of man and maiden </l>
<l>By that dark entrance I beheld. </l>
<l>One knelt in prayer; one, overladen </l>
<l>With the numb miseries of eld, </l>
<l>Submissive bowed. Another bent </l>
<l>Earthward her face. Some crouched or leant</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Clinging together as the haven </l>
<l>Of nothingness they gathered nigh. </l>
<l>But under them these words engraven </l>
<l>Spake for the sculptor's imagery: </l>
<l>"They that in darkness sat have seen </l>
<l>Great light." And I descried between</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The frowning walls two lovers sleeping </l>
<l>As though the Everlasting Arms </l>
<l>Indeed were under them and keeping </l>
<l>Far from their rest all needs and harms. </l>
<l>And light which seemed no light of day </l>
<l>Dwelt on them like the Shekinah.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The poppy of oblivion covers </l>
<l>The legend and the name of these. </l>
<l>Roses lie strewn by pilgrim-lovers </l>
<l>On Ab&#x00E9;lard and H&#x00E9;loise </l>
<l>Summer on summer, year by year, </l>
<l>But never a blossom withers here.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For to the weak, the world-defeated, </l>
<l>Bound on the Ixionian wheel </l>
<l>Of toil, or trodden down and treated </l>
<l>As dross that clogs our age of steel;</l>
<l>Ay, and when dead, like worthless dross </l>
<l>Whose bodies fill the common fosse,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The lives awry, the misbegotten, </l>
<l>Foredoomed to failure from their birth, </l>
<l>With stunted soul and body rotten, </l>
<l>The disinherited of earth, </l>
<l>This monument of limestone grey </l>
<l>Was carven by Bartholom&#x00E9;.</l>

<l>AWHILE I dreamed: to me an angel came,</l>
<l>Bright with the glory of the dawn's first flame; </l>
<l>But as he paus'd ever beside him stood </l>
<l>A ghastly spectre, grim in robe and hood.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The first one brought a wondrous sense of peace, </l>
<l>As if his voice could bid all sorrow cease. </l>
<l>He wore immortal roses in his hair, </l>
<l>And when he smiled I knew how heaven was fair.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The second, scowling, as he hurried past </l>
<l>Athwart the sun a blighting shadow cast; </l>
<l>And where he walked, with grim averted head, </l>
<l>The very grass had withered 'neath his tread.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Who art thou? say!" unto the first I cried.</l>
<l>"I am God's servant, Death," soft tones replied.</l>
<l>"And that dread shape which ever walks with thee?"</l>

<l>HERE in the marshland, past the battered bridge,</l>

<l>THEY passed in dusty black defile </l>
<l>Along the burning champaign's edge, </l>
<l>Where English oaks for many a mile</l>
<l>Dripped acorns o'er the berried hedge.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>With valorous smiles on faces soiled, </l>
<l>Out of the autumn's heat and light, </l>
