Installation
------------

Non Pip Dependancies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install all the necessary components for a development environment
on an Ubuntu 10.04 workstation:

sudo apt-get install python-ldap python-lxml python-ply python-dateutil fop libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev

Create A Virtual Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
sudo pip install virtualenv

If the source is in /home/greatwar/src, consider creating an environment in  /home/greatwar/greatwarEnv.
To create the environment, su into apache's user (for local development do not su to another user)
and::
	  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages /home/greatwar/greatwarEnv

This creates a new virtual environment in that directory. Source the activation
file to invoke the virtual environment (requires that you use the bash shell)::

	  $ . /home/greatwar/greatwarEnv/bin/activate

Once the environment has been activated inside a shell, Python programs
spawned from that shell will read their environment only from this
directory, not from the system-wide site packages. Installations will
correspondingly be installed into this environment.

Note::
Installation instructions and upgrade notes below assume that
you are already in an activated shell.

Pip Dependancies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install python dependencies, cd into the repository checkout and::

	  $ pip install -r pip-dependencies

Settings
^^^^^^^^
Install and configure like other django applications.

Copy localsettings-sample.py to localsettings.py and customize the settings.
The site does not require special permission to access Fedora.
FEDORA_USER and FEDORA_PASS variables should NOT be configured in staging or production.


PidMan
^^^^^^
* The user 'greatwar' will have to be created through the pidman admin interface
if it does not already exist. It shold be able to add and edit pids and targets.
The 'Resource Manager' permission group should be suficent for this user.
Also, the staff flag  shold be set to true.

* The 'Great War' will have to be created as a sub-domain of BeckCenter if it does not already exist.



Fedora
^^^^^^
* Make sure that the greatwar fedora policies are updated to the specified version.
* To create the Greatwar fedora Collection run the following command from witin
the the directory <repocheckout>/greatwar::
          $ python ./manage.py syncrepo -u <username> --password
You should use the fedoraAdmin user with this command.

* To ingest postcards into fedora run the followng command::
          $ python ./manage.py ingest_postcards <postcards.xml> <image_dir> -u <username> --password
You should use the fedoraAdmin user with this command.
NOTE: This sep will most likely be done after the deployment because the dat is stored in another location.


eXist
^^^^^
* The user 'greatwar' will have to be created through the eXist admin interface
if it does not already exist. It should be assigned to the DBA group.

* The collection 'greatwar' will have to be created through the eXist admin interface
if it does not already exist. It should exist under the group beck group and owned by greatwar.

* Run the following command to load the index::
          $ python ./manage.py help existdb_index
          $ python ./manage.py help existdb_reindex

For a first-time install, you will should run these two steps:
(Note that if all poetry is loaded, the reindex step can take quite a while)::

         $ python ./manage.py existdb_index load
         $ python ./manage.py existdb_reindex

Apache
^^^^^^
This should be configured to run under WSGI.
Create an apache config to use the provided .wsgi.
