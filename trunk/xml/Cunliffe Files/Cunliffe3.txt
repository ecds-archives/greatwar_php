HERE: AND THERE
September, 1914

HERE

Soft benediction of September sun; 
Voices of children, laughing as they run; 
Green English lawns, bright flowers and butterflies; 
And over all the blue embracing skies.

THERE

Tumult and roaring of the incessant gun; 
Dead men and dying, trenches lost and won; 
Blood, mud, and havoc, bugles, shoutings, cries; 
And over all the blue embracing skies.
##-- F. W. Bourdillon.

KART狙HKIYA-BER撚A

It is twelve years since I have been there --
I was born there, 
In the little town, by the river --
It all comes back to me now 
Reading in the newspaper:
<l rend="italic">"The Germans have seized the bridge-head at Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a;
The Russians are retreating in good order across the marshes; 
The town is in flames."

Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a! 
Sweet-sounding, time-scented name --
Smelling of wide-extending marshes of hay; 
Smelling of cornfields; 
Smelling of apple-orchards; 
Smelling of cherry-trees in full blossom; 
Smelling of all the pleasant recollections of my childhood --
Smelling of Grandmother's kitchen, 
Grandmother's freshly-baked dainties, 
Grandmother's plum-pudding --
Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!

<pb n="33"/>
I see before me a lane running between two rows of straggling cottages --
I cannot remember the name of the lane;
I do not know whether it has any name at all;
But I remember it was broad and unpaven and shaded with wide-branching chestnuts --
And enters the market-place 
Just a few houses after my Grandfather's --
Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!

I can see it even now 
My Grandfather's house --
On the lane, to the right, as you come from the market-place;
A big, hospitable frame building --
Big like my Grandfather's own heart, 
And hospitable like Grandmother's smile --
I can see it even now,
With the white-pillared porch in the centre and the sharp-gabled roof
Pierced with little windows;
And the great quadrangular garden behind it;
And the tall fence surrounding the garden;
And the old well in the corner of the garden;
With the bucket-lift 
Rising over the fence --
Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!

<pb n="34"/>
I can see him even now, 
My Grandfather --
Bending over me, tall and sad-eyed and thoughtful
Lifting me up and seating me on his knees 
Lovingly,
And listening to all my childish questions and confessions;
Pardoning, admonishing, remonstrating --
Satisfying my interrogative soul with good-humored indulgence --
And my Grandmother,
Dear little woman!
I can never dissociate her from plum-pudding and apple dumplings,
And raisin-cakes and almond cakes and crisp potato pancakes
And the smell of fish frying on the fire --
And then there is my cousin, Miriam, 
Who lived in the yellow house across the lane --
A freckle-faced, cherry-eyed little girl with a puckered-up nose.
I was very romantic about her;
And then there is my curse, my rival at school, my arch-enemy --
Jacob, 
The synagogue sexton's boy, 
On whom 1 was always warring --
<pb n="35"/>
God knows on what battlefield he must be lying now!
And then there is Nathan and Joseph and Berel and Solomon
And Ephraim, the baker's boy, 
And Baruch and Gershen and Mendel
And long-legged, sandy-haired Emanuel who fell into the pond with me that time,
While we were skating on the ice --
Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!

I can see myself even now 
In the lane on a summer's day, 
Cap in hand, chasing after dragon-flies --
Suddenly, near by, sounds the noise of drums and bugles --
I know what that means!
Breathlessly I dash up the lane --
It is the regiment quartered in the barracks at the end of the town, in its annual parade on the highway --
How I would wish to be one of those gray-coated heroes!
I watch them eager-eyed --
And run after them until they reach the Gentile Quarter --
And then I turn back --
Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!

<pb n="36"/>
I am in the market-place --
At a Fair;
The market-place is a heaving mass of carts and horses and oxen;
The oxen are lowing, the horses are neighing, the peasants are cursing in a dozen different dialects --
I am in Grandfather's store,
On the lower end of the market-place, right opposite the public well --
The store is full of peasants and peasant women, bargaining at the top of their voices;
The men are clad in rough sheepskin coats and fur caps;
The women are gay in bright-colored cottons and wear red kerchiefs around their heads;
My Grandfather is standing behind the counter measuring out rope to some peasants;
Grandmother is cutting a strip of linen for a peasant woman, chaffering with another one at the same time, about the price of a pair of sandals --
And I am sitting there, behind the counter, on a sack of flour,
Playing with my black-eyed little cousin --

Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!
Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a!
It comes back to me suddenly --
<pb n="37"/>
That I am sitting here, with a newspaper in my hand,
Reading:
<l rend="italic">"The Germans have seized the bridge-head at Kart랍hkiya-Ber듴a;
<l rend="italic">The Russians are retreating in good order across the marshes;
<l rend="italic">The town is in flames!"

AFTERMATH

Yes, he is gone, there is the message, see! 
Slain by a Prussian bullet as he led 
The men that loved him -- dying, cheered them on --
My son, my eldest son. So be it, God!

This is no time for tears, no time to mourn, 
No time for sombre draperies of woe. 
Let the aggressors weep! for they have sinned 
The sin of Satan. Lust of power and pride, 
Mean envy of their neighbors' weal, a plot 
Hatched amidst glozing smiles and prate of peace 
Through the false years; until the Day, the Day 
When all this worship at the Devil's feet 
Should win the world. Ay, let them weep!
<l rend="indent44">But we 
With eyes undimmed march on; our mourning robes 
Be-jewelled by the deeds of those that die, 
Lustre on lustre, till no sable patch 
Peeps through their brilliance.
<l rend="indent33">In the years to come, 
When we have done our work, and God's own peace,
<pb n="40"/>
The Peace of Justice, Mercy, Righteousness, 
Like the still radiance of a summer's dawn, 
With tranquil glory floods a troubled world; 
Why then, perhaps, in the old hall at home, 
Where once I dreamed my eldest-born should stand 
The master, as I stand the master now, 
Our eyes, my wife, shall meet and gleam, and mark 
Niched on the walls in sanctity of pride, 
Hal's sword, Dick's medal, and the cross he won 
Yet never wore. That is the time for tears, 
Drawn from a well of love deep down; deep down, 
Deep as the mystery of immortal souls, 
That is the time for tears; not now, not now!

THE RETURN

Home across the clover 
When the war was over 
Came the young men slowly with an air of being old, 
On a morning blue and gold 
Through the weed-grown meadow-places 
Marched young soldiers with old faces, 
Marched the columns of the Emperor with dull, bewildered eyes, 
And the day was like a rose upon the skies; 
But they feared both light and life, 
Feared the aftermath of strife. 
Slow they came --
INDENTNow that it was over --
Silent and sick and lame,
INDENTHome across the clover.

A woman knelt in a garden by the road,
INDENTPatting a little mound of earth 
With aimless hands. Along the highway flowed
INDENTThe gray tide, while the day was at its birth. 
She heard the drums, looked up, half smiled:
INDENT"Why do you march," she said, "and play at soldiers?
<pb n="42"/>
There's none to laugh at you -- no little child!
INDENTNot one. They've all gone back to sleeping."
INDENTShe fell to awful weeping.
INDENT"Why do you play at soldiers?"
Then dropped down
To pat the little grave. The line went on and on into the town.

They saw it first in the city's eyes,
INDENTOld men grouped by their fright, ran here and there
In startled herds, with shrill unmeaning cries.
INDENTAnd there was white in every woman's hair,
And when a window yielded them a face
INDENT'Twas like a flower blasted by the sun;
INDENTChildren there were none.
The world seemed robbed of joyousness and grace,
INDENTA young girl with a head of snow
Sat weaving garlands in the market-place
INDENTWith hands unearthly slow,
As though her toil must be
The very measure of eternity.
A boy ran from the ranks, stooped, touched her brow;
<l rend="italic">"Margot, Margot! Is it thou?"
She did not glance up at the white-faced lad.
INDENTDeep in the gray line rang a sudden shout:
<l rend="italic">"They're mad! They're mad !"
INDENT<hi rend="italic">"Silence, you dogs, until you're mustered out.</hi>
<l rend="italic">Forward, to greet the Emperor."
<pb n="43"/>
<l rend="indent29">The line 
Wavered and moaned and stumbled through the town
INDENTLike some dark serpent with a broken spine. 
Before the palace gate, in cloak and crown, 
A shriveled figure sat with shaking hands, 
Forming toy soldiers into various bands. 
A figure in a jeweled diadem,
INDENTWho, as the swords leaped with a ringing noise, 
Lifted his wasted eyes and looked at them.
INDENT"Ah !" said the Emperor, and smiled: 
<l rend="indent4">"More toys!"
