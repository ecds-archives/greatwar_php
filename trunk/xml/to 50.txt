<head rend="center">Requiem</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">LET others comfort your distress</l>
<l>With soldier tales of simple art,</l>
<l>Telling his strength, his manliness,</l>
<l>The noble way he played his part.</l>
<l>You should be proud; -- ah, gallant heart,</l>
<l>Say not that pride is comfortless.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I have rarer words than praise,</l>
<l>For more than common love was mine,</l>
<l>And now his dear remembered ways</l>
<l>Are treasured in the sacred shrine</l>
<l>Where human mingles with divine,</l>
<l>A solace for the lonely days.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He battled for no worldly hire,</l>
<l>No stern ambition to appease,</l>
<l>From fight to fight his heart's desire</l>
<l>Was set on higher things than these --</l>
<l>His home beside the English seas,</l>
<l>And children's faces round the fire,</l></lg>

<pb n="92"/>
<lg>
<l>Red clouds, and the low sun agleam</l>
<l>In cottage windows dim with age,</l>
<l>The summer sounds of wood and stream,</l>
<l>These were his faith, his heritage;</l>
<l>His life -- a happy pilgrimage,</l>
<l>And death the dawning of a dream.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And on that day he went to die</l>
<l>His spirit soared on rainbow wings,</l>
<l>Gladly he went, with head held high,</l>
<l>And singing as a lover sings</l>
<l>To greet the dusky night, that brings</l>
<l>His hour of happiness more nigh.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Ah, surely when his life was sped</l>
<l>That spirit hastened to your side.</l>
<l>Would you but raise your weeping head</l>
<l>You'd hear him whisper in the tide,</l>
<l>Or on the winds of heaven ride</l>
<l>For ever with the mighty dead.</l></lg>

<l n="1">MY ways are lonely and apart,</l>
<l rend="indent">My very name a thing of fear</l>
<l>I am the man without a heart,</l>
<l rend="indent">I am the Lord High Bombardier.</l></lg>

<l>My mattins is the shrapnel's scream,</l>
<l rend="indent">My evensong the bullet's crack;</l>
<l>The happy state of which I dream</l>
<l rend="indent">To strafe and never be strafed back.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Oft-times with Red Hats hovering near</l>
<l rend="indent">I hold a mystic high debate</l>
<l>On how to fill the Boche with fear,</l>
<l rend="indent">On Frightfulness, or "What is Hate?"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>How some bombs burst long ere they land,</l>
<l rend="indent">Others, the choicest, as they fall;</l>
<l>How some dissect the thrower's hand,</l>
<l rend="indent">While most will never burst at all.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>With that spring-throated Juggernaut</l>
<l rend="indent">That spits explosive at the sky.</l>
<l>No dark-browed scholar devil-taught</l>
<l rend="indent">Could be more intimate than I.</l></lg>

<pb n="94"/>
<lg>
<l>For me no more the secret cult</l>
<l rend="indent">Of "Jampot," "Hairbrush," "Pitcher," "Ball,"</l>
<l>Holds fear; the erratic catapult</l>
<l rend="indent">Has lost all power to appal.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>With many a brother anarchist</l>
<l rend="indent">By night I prowl from ten till one,</l>
<l>Thirsting to keep a bloody tryst</l>
<l rend="indent">With some rotund unready Hun.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So runs my life, but when the end</l>
<l rend="indent">Comes on the wings of shot or shell,</l>
<l>No tears will save, nor loving friend,</l>
<l rend="indent">For me there waits the bomber's Hell,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Where with the unsubstantial shades</l>
<l rend="indent">In groves where shells eternal fall</l>
<l>I'll fill Satanic hand-grenades</l>
<l rend="indent">With fourth-dimension ammonal.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Against the beasts in men let loose from their cages</l>

<l>And we look him full in the eyes; we are rid of our last terror.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>True that Death is an ill, but the worse ills are many;</l>
<l rend="indent">Shame and slow rotting, cold and greasy years,</l>
<l rend="indent">Pride in dishonour -- these things hold our fears;</l>
<l>We can play pitch and toss with our lives as a boy with a penny.</l></lg>

<l>We have spent ourselves to win us a lady's favour,</l>
<l rend="indent">But now the spending is grown to a leaping fire,</l>
<l rend="indent">And winning for ourselves seems but a strange desire;</l>
<l>Her eyes are remote as stars; her kisses have lost their savour.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We have put life away and spurn the ways of the living;</l>
<l rend="indent">We have broken with the old selves who gathered and got,</l>
<l rend="indent">And are free with the freedom of men who have not;</l>
<l>We partake the heroic fervours of giving and again giving.</l></lg>

<l>Yea, life was given to be given; March onward, my brothers!</l></lg>
