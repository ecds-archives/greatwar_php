<l>I CLIMBED a hill as light fell short.</l>
<l>And rooks came home in scramble sort.</l>
<l>And filled the trees and flapped and fought</l>
<l>And sang themselves to sleep;</l>
<l>An owl from nowhere with no sound</l>
<l>Swung  by  and  soon  was  nowhere found,</l>
<l>I heard him calling half-way round,</l>
<l>Holloing loud and deep ;</l>
<l>A pair of stars, faint pins of light,</l>
<l>Then many a star, sailed into sight,</l>
<l>And all the stars, the flower of night,</l>
<l>Were round me at a leap;</l>
<l>To tell how still the valleys lay</l>
<l>I heard a watchdog miles away,</l>
<l>And bells of distant sheep.</l></lg>

<l>I heard no more of bird or bell,</l>

<l>As wondering men have always done</l>
<l>Since beauty and the stars were one</l>
<l>Though none so hard as I.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>It seemed, so still the valleys were,</l>
<l>As if the whole world knelt at prayer,</l>

<l>So pure and wide that silence was</l>
<l>I feared to bend a blade of grass,</l>
<l>And there I stood like stone.</l></lg>

<l>As sharp and sweet and clear</l>
<l>As if the Abyssinian tree</l>
<l>Had thrust a bough across the sea,</l>
<l>Had thrust a bough across to me</l>
<l>With music for my ear!</l></lg>

<l>I heard them both, and oh! I heard</l>
<l>The song of every singing bird</l>

<l>The song of mountains, moths and men</l>
<l>And seas and rainbows vie!</l></lg>

<l>In human sense and soul:</l>
<l>The song of poets when they write</l>

<l>Upon a flying scroll,</l>
<l>The song of painters when they take</l>
<l>A burning brush for Beauty's sake</l>
<l>And limn her features whole--</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>The song of men divinely wise</l>
<l>Who look and see in starry skies</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>The song of courage, heart and will</l>
<l>And gladness in a fight,</l>

<l>The bells and bells of song that ring</l>
<l>Round banners of a cause or king</l>
<l>From armies bleeding white--</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>The song of sailors every one</l>

<l>Crammed up in cities grim and grey</l>
<l>As thick as bees in hives,</l>
<l>Hosannas of a lowly throng</l>
<l>Who sing unconscious of their song.</l>
<l>Whose lips are in their lives--</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>And song of some at holy war</l>
<l>With spells and ghouls more dread by far</l>
<l>Than deadly seas and cities are</l>

<l>Borne up and off from here and now</l>
<l>Into the void sublime!</l></lg>

<l>And intermission none--</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>And burst on burst for beauty and</l>

<l>From men whose love of motherland</l>

<l>From lonely hearths too grey to tell,</l>
<l>God knows how utter grey !</l>

<l>The ruby's and the rainbow's song,</l>
<l>The nightingale's -- all three,</l>
