<head rend="center">God</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I WENT alone into the fields to-night.</l>
<l>And stood upon the hillside, where the oaks</l>
<l>Have stood and talked of God in the twilight</l>
<l>For centuries, and cracked their ancient jokes</l>
<l rend="indent">Over our heads; those veterans know more</l>
<l rend="indent">Of God than we have learned with all our lore.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I pressed my cheek against an oak's rough bark,</l>
<l>And watched the sun drop down behind the hill;</l>
<l>Silence fell on the valley; the last lark</l>
<l>Was hushed; and suddenly the wind was still ...</l>
<l rend="indent">A breath of air went rustling through the trees,</l>
<l rend="indent">And God passed by me in the sunset breeze.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A clock chimed in the valley down below;</l>
<l>Some children shouted; and the blue smoke curled</l>
<l>Out of the cottage chimneys -- 'twas as though</l>
<l>There could be nothing ugly in the world;</l>
<l rend="indent">The lights gleamed from the houses in the wood;</l>
<l rend="indent">And God smiled, for He saw that it was good.</l></lg>

<pb n="52"/>
<lg>
<l>Then, as I laid my head upon the ground,</l>
<l>And waited there for dark night's close embrace,</l>
<l>I heard, far off, a murmuring, rumbling sound,</l>
<l>As if the earth groaned at her own disgrace;</l>
<l rend="indent">It trembled on the breeze, swelled, and then died;</l>
<l rend="indent">Again the branches rustled, and God sighed.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">LIKE a vast forest on some distant plain,</l>
<l rend="indent">Out in the west, dark, rounded clouds lay low</l>
<l>Upon the sea: o'er them, the sun's broad train --</l>
<div2 id="moresongs0" type="poem" n="">
<l rend="indent">The glories of the golden afterglow.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Gold, and then crimson: changing, through degrees</l>
<l rend="indent">Of red and green, to fields of turquoise blue:</l>
<l>Then darker blue, that challenges the seas</l>
<l rend="indent">To deeper darkness, as the storm-clouds do.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then, when the stars gleamed faintly, blushing red</l>
<l rend="indent">At their own eagerness: and as this feast</l>
<l>Of beauty seemed complete, and day was dead,</l>
<l rend="indent">I turned my face, and looked toward the east.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There I saw that which made me hold my breath;</l>
<l rend="indent">I'd thought the sunset fair now met my sight,</l>
<pb n="53"/>
<l>In perfect contrast -- like the peace of death</l>
<l rend="indent">After life's glare -- the grandeur of the night.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In empty sky, still tinged with wondrous blue,</l>
<l rend="indent">The full moon hung, displaying royally</l>
<l>Her cold and naked beauty, as she threw</l>
<l rend="indent">Her path of silver moonbeams on the sea.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>God showed me then, that, if we learn to love</l>
<l rend="indent">The beauties that He sends us in our day,</l>
<l>More lovely yet will night celestial prove --</l>
<l rend="indent">The perfect calm of passions passed away.</l></lg>
