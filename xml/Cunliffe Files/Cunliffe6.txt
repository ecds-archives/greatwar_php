<l>The tide passed, and the waves came and whispered about his ankles.</l>
<l>Far off he heard a cock crow -- children laughing,</l>
<l>Rising at dawn to greet the storm of petals</l>
<l>Shaken from apple-boughs; he heard them cry,</l>
<l>And turned again to find the breast of her,</l>
<l>And sank confus&egrave;d with a little sigh...</l>
<l>Thereafter water running, and a voice</l>
<l>That seemed to stir and flutter through the trenches</l>
<l>And set dead lips to talking...</l></lg>

<l n="1">D<hi rend="smallcaps">eath</hi> and Sorrow and Sleep:</l>
<l>Here where the slow waves creep,</l>
<l rend="indent">This is the chant I hear,</l>
<l>The chant of the measureless deep.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What was Sorrow to me</l>
<l>Then, when the young life free</l>
<l rend="indent">Thirsted for joys of earth,</l>
<l>Far from the desolate sea?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What was Sleep but a rest,</l>
<l>Giving to youth the best</l>
<l rend="indent">Dreams from the ivory gate,</l>
<l>Visions of God manifest?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What was death but a tale</l>
<l>Told to faces grown pale,</l>
<l rend="indent">Worn or wasted with years --</l>
<l>A meaningless thing to the hale?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Death and Sorrow and Sleep:</l>
<l>Now their sad message I keep,</l>
<l rend="indent">Tossed on the wet wind's breath,</l>
<l>The chant of the measureless deep.</l></lg>
