<l rend="indent">How Fury forced the Belgian door</l>
<l>And ravished maids, struck children dead,</l>

<l rend="indent">Our sires with blood and sweat begat,</l>
<l>Ask with the pride your greatness gives,</l>
<l rend="indent">"What said America to that?"</l></lg>

<l>Your children -- taught how Belgium stood</l>
<l rend="indent">In flames that once were called Louvain,</l>

<l rend="indent">Struck at her foe and struck again --</l>
<l>Shall feel their hearts within them burn</l>
<l rend="indent">To know that righteous word you said;</l>
<l>God! When the silent truth they learn,</l>
<l rend="indent">Surely your sons will hang the head.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We ask not that of all your hosts</l>
<l rend="indent">One man, one sword be sacrificed:</l>
<l>Your cousins guard these ancient coasts,</l>
<l rend="indent">Your kinsmen charge this Antichrist:</l>
<pb n="16"/>
<l>But we expect your mighty voice</l>
<l rend="indent">With judgment through the world to run,</l>
<l>O land of freedom, make your choice,</l>
<l rend="indent">Are you for Belgium or the Hun?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We ask not that your shells should shriek</l>
<l rend="indent">Above the flaming hills we climb,</l>
<l>But speak, O sons of Lincoln, speak!</l>
<l rend="indent">Silence in such an hour is crime.</l>
<l>Your children judge you if you stand</l>
<l rend="indent">In hearing of the Belgian cry,</l>
<l>Not only with the folded hand,</l>
<l rend="indent">But with the cold, averted eye!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The soul has got its piercing steel,</l>
<l rend="indent">The heart its fierce consuming fire,</l>
<l>Oh, make your voice like thunder peal,</l>
<l rend="indent">All nations of the earth inspire!</l>
<l>We know your heart for Belgium bleeds,</l>
<l rend="indent">But speak your soul, declare your mind,</l>
<l>Speak till the sin-red tyrant heeds</l>
<l rend="indent">The voice of God and all mankind.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">THE RED COUNTRY</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I<hi rend="smallcaps">n</hi> the red country</head>
<head rend="center">The sky flowers</l>
<l>All day.</l>
<l>Strange mechanical birds</l>
<l>With struts of wire and glazed wings</l>
<l>Cross the impassive sky</l>
<l>Which burgeons ever and again</l>
<l>With ephemeral unfolding flowers,</l>
<l>White and yellow and brown,</l>
<l>That spread and dissolve.</l>
<l>And smaller rapid droning birds go by,</l>
<l>And bright metallic bees whose sting is death.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behind the hills,</l>
<l>Behind the whispering woods whose leaves are falling</l>
<l>Yellow and red to cover the red clay,</l>
<l>Misshapen monsters squat with wide black maws</l>
<l>Gulping smoke and belching flame.</l>
<l>From the mirk reed beds of the age of coal,</l>
<l>Wallowing out of their sleep in the earlier slime,</l>
<l>They are resurrected and stagger forth to slay --</l>
<l>The prehistoric Beasts we thought were dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="18"/>
<l>They are blinded with long sleep,</l>
<l>But men with clever weapons</l>
<l>Goad them to fresh pastures.</l>
<l>Beside still waters</l>
<l>They drink of blood and neigh a horrible laughter,</l>
<l>And their ponderous tread shakes happy cities down,</l>
<l>And the thresh of their flail-like tails</l>
<l>Makes acres smoulder and smoke</l>
<l>Blackened of golden harvest.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The Beasts are back,</l>
<l>And men, in their spreading shadow,</l>
<l>Inhale the odor of their nauseous breath.</l>
<l>Inebriate with it they fashion other gods</l>
<l>Than the gods of day-dream.</l>
<l>Of iron and steel are little images</l>
<l>Made of the Beasts.</l>
<l>And men rush forth and fling themselves for ritual</l>
<l>Before these gods, before the lumbering Beasts, --</l>
<l>And some make long obeisance.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Umber and violet flowers of the sky,</l>
<l>The sun, like a blazing Mars, clanks across the blue</l>
<l>And plucks you, to fashion into a nosegay</l>
<l>To offer Venus, his old-time paramour.</l>
<l>But now she shrinks</l>
<pb n="19"/>
<l>And pales</l>
<l>Like Cynthia, her more ascetic sister...</l>
<l>Vulcan came to her arms in the grimy garb</l>
<l>Of toil, he smelt of the forge and the racketing workshop,</l>
<l>But not of blood.</l>
<l>And, if she smells these flowers, they bubble ruby blood</l>
<l>That trickles between her fingers.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet is a dream flowing over the red country,</l>
<l>Yet is a light growing, for all the black furrows of the red country...</l>
<l>The machines are foe or friend</l>
<l>As the world desires.</l>
<l>The Beasts shall sleep again.</l>
<l>And in that sleep, when the land is twilight-still</l>
<l>And men take thought among the frozen waves of the dead,</l>
<l>The Sowers go forth once more,</l>
<l>Sowers of vision, sowers of the seed</l>
<l>Of peace or war.</l>
<l>Shall it be peace indeed?</l>
<l>Great shadowy figures moving from hill to hill</l>
<l>Of tangled bodies, with rhythmic stride and cowled averted head,</l>
<l>What do you sow with hands funereal --</l>
<l>New savageries imperial,</l>
<pb n="20"/>
<l>Unthinking pomps for arrogant, witless men?</l>
<l>Or seed for the people in strong democracy?</l>
<l>What do you see</l>
<l>With your secret eyes, and sow for us, that we must reap again?</l></lg>

<l>The proud Professors toe the line</l>
<l>And turn to the left for right incline.</l>
<l>Forgot, forgot are their divers lores</l>
<l>In the patriot stress of forming fours.</l>
<l>Their mortar-boards are a hive for bees</l>
<l>(Which they often were) as they stand at ease.</l>
<l>Though every morn they are wisdom's fount</l>
<l>In matters which nowadays hardly count,</l>
<l>Each afternoon each neophyte</l>
<l>Gets totally mixed between left and right</l>
<l>(And a don at maths. and a logic don</l>
<l>Turn each to each and are pounced upon).</l>
<l>At the terrible voice of the tu -- the sergeant</l>
<l>Their gills go gules and their locks more argent.</l>
<l>And still as the breath comes short, and the knees</l>
<l>Wobble in places, and many a wheeze</l>
<l>Is torn from the depth of complaining tums,</l>
<l>Down the weak line the whisper comes:</l>

<l>A publisher and sundry heads of houses,</l>
