<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">C<hi rend="smallcaps">ourage</hi> came to you with your boyhood's grace</l>
<l>Of ardent life and limb.</l>
<l>Each day new dangers steeled you to the test,</l>
<l>To ride, to climb, to swim.</l>
<l>Your hot blood taught you carelessness of death</l>
<l>With every breath.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So when you went to play another game</l>
<l>You could not but be brave:</l>
<l>An Empire's team, a rougher football field,</l>
<l>The end -- perhaps your grave.</l>
<l>What matter? On the winning of a goal</l>
<l>You staked your soul.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yes, you wore courage as you wore your youth</l>
<l>With carelessness and joy.</l>
<l>But in what Spartan school of discipline</l>
<l>Did you get patience, boy?</l>
<l>How did you learn to bear this long-drawn pain</l>
<l>And not complain?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Restless with throbbing hopes, with thwarted aims,</l>
<l>Impulsive as a colt,</l>
<l>How do you lie here month by weary month</l>
<l>Helpless, and not revolt?</l>
<l>What joy can these monotonous days afford</l>
<l>Here in a ward?</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="206"/>
<l>Yet you are merry as the birds in spring.</l>
<l>Or feign the gaiety.</l>
<l>Lest those who dress and tend your wound each day</l>
<l>Should guess the agony.</l>
<l>Lest they should suffer -- this the only fear</l>
<l>You let draw near.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Greybeard philosophy has sought in books</l>
<l>And argument this truth,</l>
<l>That man is greater than his pain, but you</l>
<l>Have learnt it in your youth.</l>
<l>You know the wisdom taught by Calvary</l>
<l>At twenty-three.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Death would have found you brave, but braver still</l>
<l>You face each lagging day,</l>
<l>A merry Stoic, patient, chivalrous,</l>
<l>Divinely kind and gay.</l>
<l>You bear your knowledge lightly, graduate</l>
<l>Of unkind Fate.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Careless philosopher, the first to laugh,</l>
<l>The latest to complain,</l>
<l>Unmindful that you teach, you taught me this</l>
<l>In your long fight with pain:</l>
<l>Since God made man so good -- here stands my creed --</l>
<l>God's good indeed.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">W<hi rend="smallcaps">hen</hi> consciousness came back, he found he lay</l>
<l>Between the opposing fires, but could not tell</l>
<l>On which hand were his friends; and either way</l>
<l>For him to turn was chancy -- bullet and shell</l>
<l>Whistling and shrieking over him, as the glare</l>
<l>Of searchlights scoured the darkness to blind day.</l>
<l>He scrambled to his hands and knees ascare,</l>
<l>Dragging his wounded foot through puddled clay,</l>
<l>And tumbled in a hole a shell had scooped</l>
<l>At random in a turnip-field between</l>
<l>The unseen trenches where the foes lay cooped</l>
<l>Through that unending battle of unseen,</l>
<l>Dead-locked, league-stretching armies; and quite spent</l>
<l>He rolled upon his back within the pit,</l>
<l>And lay secure, thinking of all it meant --</l>
<l>His lying in that little hole, sore hit,</l>
<l>But living, while across the starry sky</l>
<l>Shrapnel and shell went screeching overhead --</l>
<l>Of all it meant that he, Tom Dodd, should lie</l>
<l>Among the Belgian turnips, while his bed...</l>
<l>If it were he, indeed, who'd climbed each night,</l>
<l>Fagged with the day's work, up the narrow stair,</l>
<l>And slipt his clothes off in the candle-light,</l>
<l>Too tired to fold them neatly in a chair</l>
<l>The way his mother'd taught him -- too dog-tired</l>
<l>After the long day's serving in the shop,</l>
<l>Inquiring what each customer required,</l>
<l>Politely talking weather, fit to drop...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now for fourteen days and nights, at least,</l>
<l>He had n't had his clothes off, and had lain</l>
<pb n="208"/>
<l>In muddy trenches, napping like a beast</l>
<l>With one eye open, under sun and rain</l>
<l>And that unceasing hell-fire...</l>
<l>It was strange</l>
<l>How things turned out -- the changes! You'd just got</l>
<l>To take your luck in life, you could n't change</l>
<l>Your luck.</l>
<l>And so here he was lying shot</l>
<l>Who just six months ago had thought to spend</l>
<l>His days behind a counter. Still, perhaps...</l>
<l>And now, God only knew how he would end!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He'd like to know haw many of the chaps</l>
<l>Had won back to the trench alive, when he</l>
<l>Had fallen wounded and been left for dead,</l>
<l>If any!...</l>
<l>This was different, certainly,</l>
<l>From selling knots of tape and reels of thread</l>
<l>And knots of tape and reels of thread and knots</l>
<l>Of tape and reels of thread and knots of tape,</l>
<l>Day in, day out, and answering "Have you got"'s</l>
<l>And "Do you keep"'s till there seemed no escape</l>
<l>From everlasting serving in a shop,</l>
<l>Inquiring what each customer required,</l>
<l>Politely talking weather, fit to drop,</l>
<l>With swollen ankles, tired...</l>
<l>But he was tired</l>
<l>Now. Every bone was aching, and had ached</l>
<l>For fourteen days and nights in that wet trench --</l>
<l>Just duller when he slept than when he waked --</l>
<l>Crouching for shelter from the steady drench</l>
<l>Of shell and shrapnel...</l>
<pb n="209"/>
<l>That old trench, it seemed</l>
<l>Almost like home to him. He'd slept and fed</l>
<l>And sung and smoked in it, while shrapnel screamed</l>
<l>And shells went whining harmless overhead --</l>
<l>Harmless, at least, as far as he...</l>
<l>But Dick --</l>
<l>Dick had n't found them harmless yesterday,</l>
<l>At breakfast, when he'd said he could n't stick</l>
<l>Eating dry bread, and crawled out the back way,</l>
<l>And brought them butter in a lordly dish --</l>
<l>Butter enough for all, and held it high,</l>
<l>Yellow and fresh and clean as you would wish --</l>
<l>When plump upon the plate from out the sky</l>
<l>A shell fell bursting... Where the butter went,</l>
<l>God only knew!...</l>
<l>And Dick... He dared not think</l>
<l>Of what had come to Dick... or what it meant --</l>
<l>The shrieking and the whistling and the stink</l>
<l>He'd lived in fourteen days and nights. 'T was luck</l>
<l>That he still lived... And queer how little then</l>
<l>He seemed to care that Dick... perhaps 't was pluck</l>
<l>That hardened him -- a man among the men --</l>
<l>Perhaps... Yet, only think things out a bit,</l>
<l>And he was rabbit-livered, blue with funk!</l>
<l>And he'd liked Dick... and yet when Dick was hit,</l>
<l>He hadn't turned a hair. The meanest skunk</l>
<l>He should have thought would feel it when his mate</l>
<l>Was blown to smithereens -- Dick, proud as punch,</l>
<l>Grinning like sin, and holding up the plate --</l>
<l>But he had gone on munching his dry hunch,</l>
<l>Unwinking, till he swallowed the last crumb.</l>
<pb n="210"/>
<l>Perhaps 't was just because he dared not let</l>
<l>His mind run upon Dick, who'd been his chum.</l>
<l>He dared not now, though he could not forget.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Dick took his luck. And, life or death, 't was luck</l>
<l>From first to last; and you'd just got to trust</l>
<l>Your luck and grin. It was n't so much pluck</l>
<l>As knowing that you'd got to, when needs must,</l>
<l>And better to die grinning...</l>
<l>Quiet now</l>
<l>Had fallen on the night. On either hand</l>
<l>The guns were quiet. Cool upon his brow</l>
<l>The quiet darkness brooded, as he scanned</l>
<l>The starry sky. He'd never seen before</l>
<l>So many stars. Although, of course, he'd known</l>
<l>That there were stars, somehow before the war</l>
<l>He'd never realised them -- so thick-sown,</l>
<l>Millions and millions. Serving in the shop,</l>
<l>Stars didn't count for much; and then at nights</l>
<l>Strolling the pavements, dull and fit to drop,</l>
<l>You didn't see much but the city lights.</l>
<l>He'd never in his life seen so much sky</l>
<l>As he'd seen this last fortnight. It was queer</l>
<l>The things war taught you. He'd a mind to try</l>
<l>To count the stars -- they shone so bright and clear.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>One, two, three, four... Ah, God, but he was tired...</l>
<l>Five, six, seven, eight...</l>
<l>Yes, it was number eight.</l>
<l>And what was the next thing that she required?</l>
<l>(Too bad of customers to come so late,</l>
<l>At closing time!) Again within the shop</l>
<pb n="211"/>
<l>He handled knots of tape and reels of thread,</l>
<l>Politely talking weather, fit to drop...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When once again the whole sky overhead</l>
<l>Flared blind with searchlights, and the shriek of shell</l>
<l>And scream of shrapnel roused him. Drowsily</l>
<l>He stared about him, wondering. Then he fell</l>
<l>Into deep dreamless slumber.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>. . . . . . . . . .</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He could see</l>
<l>Two dark eyes peeping at him, ere he knew</l>
<l>He was awake, and it again was day --</l>
<l>An August morning, burning to clear blue.</l>
<l>The frightened rabbit scuttled...</l>
<l>Far away,</l>
<l>A sound of firing... Up there, in the sky</l>
<l>Big dragon-flies hung hovering... Snowballs burst</l>
<l>About them... Flies and snowballs. With a cry</l>
<l>He crouched to watch the airmen pass -- the first</l>
<l>That he'd seen under fire. Lord, that was pluck --</l>
<l>Shells bursting all about them -- and what nerve!</l>
<l>They took their chance, and trusted to their luck</l>
<l>At such a dizzy height to dip and swerve,</l>
<l>Dodging the shell-fire...</l>
<l>Hell! but one was hit,</l>
<l>And tumbling like a pigeon, plump...</l>
<l>Thank Heaven,</l>
<l>It righted, and then turned; and after it</l>
<l>The whole flock followed safe -- four, five, six, seven,</l>
<l>Yes, they were all there safe. He hoped they'd win</l>
<l>Back to their lines in safety. They deserved,</l>
<l>Even if they were Germans... 'T was no sin</l>
<pb n="212"/>
<l>To wish them luck. Think how that beggar swerved</l>
<l>Just in the nick of time!</l>
<l>He, too, must try</l>
<l>To win back to the lines, though, likely as not,</l>
<l>He'd take the wrong turn: but he could n't lie</l>
<l>Forever in that hungry hole and rot,</l>
<l>He'd got to take his luck, to take his chance</l>
<l>Of being sniped by foes or friends. He'd be</l>
<l>With any luck in Germany or France</l>
<l>Or Kingdom-come, next morning...</l>
<l>Drearily</l>
<l>The blazing day burnt over him, shot and shell</l>
<l>Whistling and whining ceaselessly. But light</l>
<l>Faded at last, and as the darkness fell</l>
<l>He rose, and crawled away into the night.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">(A<hi rend="smallcaps">fter</hi> W. H. L<hi rend="smallcaps">eatham's</hi> <hi rend="italic">The Comrade in White</hi>)</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">U<hi rend="smallcaps">nder</hi> our curtain of fire,</l>
<l>Over the clotted clods,</l>
<l>We charged, to be withered, to reel</l>
<l>And despairingly wheel</l>
<l>When the bugles bade us retire</l>
<l>From the terrible odds.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As we ebbed with the battle-tide,</l>
<l>Fingers of red-hot steel</l>
<l>Suddenly closed on my side.</l>
<l>I fell, and began to pray.</l>
<l>I crawled on my hands and lay</l>
<pb n="213"/>
<l>Where a shallow crater yawned wide;</l>
<l>Then, -- I swooned. ...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When I woke, it was yet day.</l>
<l>Fierce was the pain of my wound,</l>
<l>But I saw it was death to stir,</l>
<l>For fifty paces away</l>
<l>Their trenches were.</l>
<l>In torture I prayed for the dark</l>
<l>And the stealthy step of my friend</l>
<l>Who, staunch to the very end,</l>
<l>Would creep to the danger zone</l>
<l>And offer his life as a mark</l>
<l>To save my own.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Night fell. I heard his tread,</l>
<l>Not stealthy, but firm and serene,</l>
<l>As if my comrade's head</l>
<l>Were lifted far from that scene</l>
<l>Of passion and pain and dread;</l>
<l>As if my comrade's heart</l>
<l>In carnage took no part;</l>
<l>As if my comrade's feet</l>
<l>Were set on some radiant street</l>
<l>Such as no darkness might haunt;</l>
<l>As if my comrade's eyes,</l>
<l>No deluge of flame could surprise,</l>
<l>No death and destruction daunt,</l>
<l>No red-beaked bird dismay,</l>
<l>Nor sight of decay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then in the bursting shells' dim light</l>
<l>I saw he was clad in white.</l>
<pb n="214"/></l>
<l>For a moment I thought that I saw the smock</l>
<l>Of a shepherd in search of his flock.</l>
<l>Alert were the enemy, too,</l>
<l>And their bullets flew</l>
<l>Straight at a mark no bullet could fail:</l>
<l>For the seeker was tall and his robe was bright;</l>
<l>But he did not flee nor quail.</l>
<l>Instead, with unhurrying stride</l>
<l>He came,</l>
<l>And gathering my tall frame,</l>
<l>Like a child, in his arms. ...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Again I swooned,</l>
<l>And awoke</l>
<l>From a blissful dream</l>
<l>In a cave by a stream.</l>
<l>My silent comrade had bound my side.</l>
<l>No pain now was mine, but a wish that I spoke, --</l>
<l>A mastering wish to serve this man</l>
<l>Who had ventured through hell my doom to revoke,</l>
<l>As only the truest of comrades can.</l>
<l>I begged him to tell me how best I might aid him,</l>
<l>And urgently prayed him</l>
<l>Never to leave me, whatever betide;</l>
<l>When I saw he was hurt --</l>
<l>Shot through he hands that were clasped in prayer!</l>
<l>Then, as the dark drops gathered there</l>
<l>And fell in the dirt,</l>
<l>The wounds of my friend</l>
<l>Seemed to me such as no man might bear.</l>
<l>Those bullet-holes in the patient hands</l>
<l>Seemed to transcend</l>
<l>All horrors that ever these war-drenched lands</l>
<l>Had known or would know till the mad world's end.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="215"/>
<l>Then suddenly I was aware</l>
<l>That his feet had been wounded, too;</l>
<l>And, dimming the white of his side,</l>
<l>A dull stain grew.</l>
<l>"You are hurt, White Comrade!" I cried.</l>
<l>His words I already foreknew:</l>
<l>"These are old wounds," said he,</l>
<l>"But of late they have troubled me."</l></lg>

<l n="1">T<hi rend="smallcaps">he</hi> W<hi rend="smallcaps">ounded</hi> C<hi rend="smallcaps">anadian</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">peaks</hi>:</l>
<l>My leg? It's off at the knee.</l>
<l>Do I miss it? Well, some. You see</l>
<l>I've had it since I was born;</l>
<l>And lately a devilish corn.</l>
<l>(I rather chuckle with glee</l>
<l>To think how I've fooled that corn.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I'll hobble around all right.</l>
<l>It is n't that, it's my face.</l>
<l>Oh, I know I'm a hideous sight,</l>
<l>Hardly a thing in place.</l>
<l>Sort of gargoyle, you'd say.</l>
<l>Nurse won't give me a glass,</l>
<l>But I see the folks as they pass</l>
<l>Shudder and turn away;</l>
<l>Turn away in distress...</l>
<l>Mirror enough, I guess.</l>
<l>I'm gay! You bet I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> gay,</l>
<l>But I was n't a while ago.</l>
<l>If you'd seen me even to-day,</l>
<pb n="216"/>
<l>The darnedest picture of woe,</l>
<l>With this Caliban mug of mine,</l>
<l>So ravaged and raw and red,</l>
<l>Turned to the wall -- in fine</l>
<l>Wishing that I was dead. ...</l>
<l>What has happened since then,</l>
<l>Since I lay with my face to the wall,</l>
<l>The most despairing of men!</l>
<l>Listen! I'll tell you all.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>That <hi rend="italic">poilu</hi> across the way,</l>
<l>With the shrapnel wound on his head,</l>
<l>Has a sister: she came to-day</l>
<l>To sit awhile by his bed.</l>
<l>All morning I heard him fret:</l>
<l>"Oh, when will she come, Fleurette?"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then sudden, a joyous cry;</l>
<l>The tripping of little feet;</l>
<l>The softest, tenderest sigh;</l>
<l>A voice so fresh and sweet;</l>
<l>Clear as a silver bell,</l>
<l>Fresh as the morning dews:</l>
<l rend="italic">"C'est toi, cest toi, Marcel!</l>
<l rend="italic">Mon fr&egrave;re, comme je suis heureuse!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So over the blanket's rim</l>
<l>I raised my terrible face,</l>
<l>And I saw -- how I envied him!</l>
<l>A girl of such delicate grace;</l>
<l>Sixteen, all laughter and love;</l>
<l>As gay as a linnet, and yet</l>
<l>As tenderly sweet as a dove;</l>
<l>Half woman, half child -- Fleurette.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="217"/>
<l>Then I turned to the wall again.</l>
<l>(I was awfully blue, you see,)</l>
<l>And I thought with a bitter pain:</l>
<l>"Such visions are not for me."</l>
<l>So there like a log I lay,</l>
<l>All hidden, I thought, from view,</l>
<l>When sudden I heard her say,</l>
<l>"Ah! Who is that <hi rend="italic">malheureux?</hi>"</l>
<l>Then briefly I heard him tell</l>
<l>(However he came to know)</l>
<l>How I'd smothered a bomb that fell</l>
<l>Into the trench, and so</l>
<l>None of my men were hit,</l>
<l>Though it busted me up a bit.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Well, I did n't quiver an eye,</l>
<l>And he chattered and there she sat;</l>
<l>And I fancied I heard her sigh --</l>
<l>But I would n't just swear that.</l>
<l>And maybe she was n't so bright,</l>
<l>Though she talked in a merry strain,</l>
<l>And I closed my eyes ever so tight,</l>
<l>Yet I saw her ever so plain:</l>
<l>Her dear little tilted nose,</l>
<l>Her delicate, dimpled chin,</l>
<l>Her mouth like a budding rose,</l>
<l>And the glistening pearls within;</l>
<l>Her eyes like the violet:</l>
<l>Such a rare little queen -- Fleurette.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And at last when she rose to go,</l>
<l>The light was a little dim,</l>
<l>And I ventured to peep, and so</l>
<l>I saw her, graceful and slim,</l>
<pb n="218"/>
<l>And she kissed him and kissed him, and oh</l>
<l>How I envied and envied him!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So when she was gone I said</l>
<l>In rather a dreary voice</l>
<l>To him of the opposite bed:</l>
<l>"Ah, friend, how you must rejoice!</l>
<l>But me, I'm a thing of dread.</l>
<l>For me nevermore the bliss</l>
<l>The thrill of a woman's kiss."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then I stopped, for lo! she was there,</l>
<l>And a great light shone in her eyes.</l>
<l>And me! I could only stare,</l>
<l>I was taken so by surprise,</l>
<l>When gently she bent her head:</l>
<l>"<hi rend="italic">May I kiss you, sergeant?</hi>" she said.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then she kissed my burning lips,</l>
<l>With her mouth like a scented flower,</l>
<l>And I thrilled to the finger-tips,</l>
<l>And I had n't even the power</l>
<l>To say: "God bless you, dear!"</l>
<l>And I felt such a precious tear</l>
<l>Fall on my withered cheek,</l>
<l>And darn it, I could n't speak.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And so she went sadly away,</l>
<l>And I know that my eyes were wet.</l>
<l>Ah, not to my dying day</l>
<l>Will I forget, forget!</l>
<l>Can you wonder now I am gay?</l>
<l>God bless her, that little Fleurette!</l></lg>
