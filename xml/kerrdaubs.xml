<head rend="center">A VIGNETTE</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>On stark and tortured wire</l>
<l>Where refuse of war lies</l>
<l>Tangled in mire--</l>
<l>When God is flinging</l>
<l>Rain down the skies--</l>
<l>Sit three little birds, singing.</l></lg></div>



<pb n="[2  FROM  THE  LINE]"/>

<div id="kerrdaubs002" type="poem" n="2">
<head rend="center">FROM THE LINE</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Have you seen men come from the Line,</l>
<l>Tottering, doddering, as if bad wine</l>
<l>Had drugged their very souls;</l>
<l>Their garments rent with holes</l>
<l>And caked with mud</l>
<l>And streaked with blood</l>
<l>Of others, or their own ;</l>
<l>Haggard, weary-limbed and chilled to the bone,</l>
<l>Trudging aimless, hopeless, on</l>
<l>With listless eyes and faces drawn</l>
<l>Taut with woe ?</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Have you seen them aimless go</l>

<l>2</l>



<pb n="[FROM THE LINE  3]"/>

<l>Bowed down with muddy pack</l>
<l>And muddy rifle slung on back,</l>
<l>And soaking overcoat,</l>
<l>Staring on with eyes that note</l>
<l>Nothing but the mire</l>
<l>Quenched of every fire ?</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Have you seen men when they come</l>
<l>From shell-holes filled with scum</l>
<l>Of mud and blood and flesh,</l>
<l>Where there's nothing fresh</l>
<l>Like grass, or trees, or flowers,</l>
<l>And the numbing year-like hours</l>
<l>Lag on--drag on,</l>
<l>And the hopeless dawn</l>
<l>Brings naught but death, and rain--</l>
<l>The rain a fiend of pain</l>

<l>3</l>



<pb n="[4  WAR DAUBS]"/>

<l>That scourges without end,</l>
<l>And Death, a smiling friend ?</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Have you seen men when they come from hell ?</l>
<l>If not,--ah, well</l>
<l>Speak not with easy eloquence</l>
<l>That seems like sense</l>
<l>Of ' War and its Necessity ' !</l>
<l>And do not rant, I pray,</l>
<l>On ' War's Magnificent Nobility' !</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>If you've seen men come from the Line</l>
<l>You'll know it's Peace that is divine !</l>
<l>If you've not seen the things I've sung--</l>
<l>Let silence bind your tongue,</l>
<l>But, make all wars to cease,</l>
<l>And work, and work for Everlasting Peace !</l>

<head rend="center">TO A SORROWING MOTHER</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>You hide your grief, Mother,</l>
<l rend="inline">But in lonely twilight times</l>
<l>You silently weep for another</l>
<l rend="inline">Who is dead.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Alone, you mourn thus;</l>
<l rend="inline">That he, whose only dirge was the wind,</l>
<l>Should be unwept by us</l>
<l rend="inline">Who laugh:</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>That we should coarsely sing</l>
<l rend="inline">In selfish merriment, unheeding,</l>
<l>Thoughtless of a thing</l>
<l rend="inline">Like his death.</l></lg>

<pb n="[6  WAR  DAUBS]"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But, ah !   Sorrowing Mother,</l>
<l rend="inline">Can we not also smile and hide</l>
<l>Our grief, who mourn a brother—</l>
<l rend="inline">Secretly ?</l></lg></div>



<pb n="[THE  CORPSE  7]"/>

<div id="kerrdaubs004" type="poem" n="4">
<head rend="center"> THE CORPSE</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>It lay on the hill,</l>
<l>A sack on its face,</l>
<l>Collarless,</l>
<l>Stiff and still,</l>
<l>Its two feet bare</l>
<l>And very white;</l>
<l>Its tunic tossed in sight</l>
<l>And not a button there--</l>
<l>Small trace</l>
<l>Of clothes upon its back--</l>
<l>Thank God ! it had a sack</l>
<l>Upon its face !</l></lg></div>



<pb n="[8  MUSIC  IN A DUG-OUT]"/>

<div id="kerrdaubs005." type="poem" n="5">
<head rend="center">MUSIC IN A DUG OUT</head>
<lg type="tanza">
<l>THE hour is drowsed vnih things of sleep</l>
<l>That round my tottering senses creep</l>
<l>Like subtle wandering scents, so rare</l>
<l>They might ensweeten fairies' hair;</l>
<l>And I am walking in a glade</l>
<l>With gold and green and purple made</l>
<l>Unearthly beautiful:</l>
<l>And, oh, the air is very cool!</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>I see green lawns between the trees,</l>
<l>And cows and sheep upon the leas,</l>
<l>And, in the distance, hills;</l>
<l>And at my feet cool, mossy rills</l>
<l>8</l>



<pb n="[MUSIC IN  A DUG-OUT  9]"/>

<l>Empurpled with the wavering shade</l>
<l>Of trees and bushes in the glade ;</l>
<l>And ever I rejoice</l>
<l>And ever sings a voice.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>I see--but, sudden the singing ceases,</l>
<l>Splintering my dream in pieces--</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>I see, in waving candle light</l>
<l>That cowers and flickers in a draft,</l>
<l>A low-roofed den--a hole of night--</l>
<l>That leaks to heaven by creaky shaft;</l>
<l>A table (where the candle stands</l>
<l>In bottle streaked with frozen strands</l>
<l>Of tallow drippings), strewn with tins</l>
<l>And cans, just tiny refuse bins</l>
<l>With smelling slops of tea and jam</l>
<l>And twisted greasy bits of ham ;</l>
<l>c                            9</l>



<pb n="[10  WAR  DAUBS]"/>

<l>And belts hung round the dingy walls</l>
<l>Like horses' harness in their stalls ;</l>
<l>And in the corner gloom, alone--</l>
<l>A dusty, silent gramophone !</l></lg></div>

<pb n="[A  PORTRAIT  11]"/>

<div id="kerrdaubs006" type="poem" n="6">
<head rend="center">A PORTRAIT</head>
<lg type="stanza">

<l>WALKING among men like a phantom,</l>
<l>With vacant eyes and listless air,</l>
<l>Unmarked, befriended, jeered at, laughed at,</l>
<l>Only smiling in reply</l>
<l>And drawing into self again</l>
<l>Like a sensitive snail within its shell;</l>
<l>Outwardly complaisant, satisfied, serene;</l>
<l>Inwardly, ah! inwardly,</l>
<l>A racked and tortured desert</l>
<l>Empty of everything but dreams--</l>
<l>Desires, ambitions,--dreams that come to naught</l>
<l>But leave the mind limp, exhausted,</l>

<l>11</l>



<pb n="[WAR  DAUBS  12]"/>

<l>Till it sees the world and life</l>
<l>Labelled with " Hopeless."</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>A ship without a compass</l>
<l>Floundering in dark and forlorn waters;</l>
<l>Seeing no harbour,</l>
<l>Knowing no goal,</l>
<l>But buffeted on relentless winds</l>
<l>That make the framework creak</l>
<l>And the nails burst !</l>
<l>A mind that grinds and grinds and grinds</l>
<l>When there's nothing in it to grind,</l>
<l>Gnawing itself away in frenzied toil,</l>
<l>And producing--</l>
<l>Nothing !</l></lg></div>

<l>A DIGGER he digs in the dark</l>
<l>In the naked remains of a wood,</l>
<l>For his friend that lies stiff and stark,</l>
<l>On his head hard blood for a hood :</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>The digging is painful and slow,</l>
<l>Yet the digger he sweats like a slave--</l>
<l>But he didn't know what I now know ;</l>
<l>The digger he dug his own grave !</l></lg></div>

<l>Once trees:</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">

<l>Did that thing live of late ?</l>
<l>That sodden thing of ebony head</l>
<l>With empty holes that gape ?</l>
<l>Good God ! will I be that, when dead ?</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Perhaps those blackened bones</l>

<l>HOME</l>

<l>A HISSING Stove whose pale blue flame</l>

<l>Boils peeled potatoes pillaged without shame</l>

<l>The night before from captured village where</l>

<l>The Germans were, not long ago ;  a chair,</l>

<l>A wooden table ; and in glimmerings shed</l>

<l>By one small candle's light, a wooden bed</l>

<l>Or two, mattressed with small heaps of straw</l>

<l>Or shreds of wood ;  and round about where paw</l>

<l>Of reckless conquerors has been,—^wild strewn,—</l>

<l>FAITH</l>

<l>I HAVE leaned on God</l>
<l>And have been comforted by Him :</l>
<l>My fears have been allayed ;</l>
<l>My terror of Death has been forgotten ;</l>
<l>My frightened heart</l>
<l>Has ceased its knocking ;</l>
<l>And my pulse has steadied,</l>
<l>And my resolution cleared and steeled.</l>
<l>I have placed my life in His hands</l>
<l>To take or leave.</l>
<l>To break or fracture—</l>
<l>As a lover gives her all.</l>
<l>Her body and her soul,</l>
<l>29</l>

<l>WAR  DAUBS</l>

<l>Unto the man she loves.</l>

<l>So I have given my all to God,</l>

<l>Surrendered to His Will</l>

<l>In absolute submission :</l>

<l>And in the hour of battle I am unafraid.</l>

<l>And I can put my finger to my nose at Death,</l>

<l>For I am not my own, but God's.</l>

<l>If He should will it,</l>

<l>He will put a bullet thro' my head ;</l>

<l>Or tear my limbs asunder with a shell;</l>

<l>Or glean my entrails out;</l>

<l>Or make me foam and choke with gas:</l>

<l>And 'twill be well.</l>

<l>But, if He will it.</l>

<l>He will turn the bullets in their flight;</l>
<l>30</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FAITH</l>

<l>Will make a stoppage in a gun ;</l>

<l>Or make a gunner's hand to tremble,</l>

<l>That his aim be false—</l>

<l>And winds of bullets will cool my cheeks,</l>
<l>And shrapnel fall like blossoms on my head !</l>

<l>THE VISION</l>

<l>Lo !  there she comes from afar</l>

<l>Her eyes tender as moonlight</l>

<l>Or the evening star</l>

<l>On a purple night</l>

<l>In Autumn !  See !</l>

<l>She is fair as a swan</l>

<l>Sailing at dawn</l>

<l>' A bullet flew by that did not miss!'</l>
<l>I did not give life up because of a friend ;</l>
<l>That bullet came thro', and that was the end !</l>

<l>Don't put up a cross where my dung will be laid.</l>
<l>But scatter some wheat—^and bread will be made ;</l>
<l>Don't say I'm a hero because I was shot;</l>
<l>A bullet won't make one what one is not.</l>

<l>Don't scribble my name upon Honour's scroll</l>

<l>What honour is there in being forced to die ?</l>
<l>We slaughter a pig—^but we make it a fry !</l>

<l>The pig can't help dying—he is forced to die ;</l>

<l>I simply must die—then why the ado ?</l>

<l>Oh ! if I should die—chatter only this—</l>
<l>' A bullet flew by that did not miss';</l>
<l>I did not give life up because of a friend ;</l>

<l>RESOLVE</l>

<l>Let me not think of blood to-night-</l>

<l>So doing</l>

<l>It will be harder still to fight:</l>

<l>Peace's wooing</l>

<l>Sucks blood making me white</l>

<l>And tremulous—</l>

<l>Thus, thus</l>

<l>I will harden yet my heart</l>

<l>Gaze into horror's face</l>

<l>Unafraid, without a trace</l>

<l>JUNE,  1918</l>

<l>June !  the joyous, sun-filled month of June</l>

<l>When roses, emblems of a heaven, croon</l>

<l>Strange melodies in garden and in hedge</l>

<l>With blithesome birds that sing in emerald edge</l>

<l>Of English lanes;   and thousand other flow'rs</l>

<l>As sweet drench incense on the air in show'rs—</l>

<l>Intoxicating wine that gives fair dreams</l>

<l>Of Palaces in Paradise, and streams</l>

<l>Of visions far surpassing Kubla Khan !</l>

<l>When cool sweet winds blow from the woods to fan</l>

<l>Two lovers lying, kissing in the grass</l>

<l>Where sun-lit waters glimpse and, laughing, pass.</l>

<l>JUNE,  1918</l>

<l>June ! a writhing, war-gorged month of hell</l>
<l>When steel and iron and high explosive yell</l>
<l>Cursed cacophonies in blasted plains.</l>
<l>With singeing bullets singing in the lanes</l>
<l>Of ripped France ;   and poisonous vapours drench</l>
<l>With death the air and earth—pocked with trench</l>
<l>And gaping scar—so he who breathes them in</l>
<l>Gulps strangling hands that clutch and tear at him,</l>
<l>And vision sees of no cool Kubla Khan ;</l>
<l>When rancid gusts from charnel tree-stumps fan</l>
<l>Two soldiers, clutching, kissing in the grass;</l>
<l>Whose souls leak out in spurting red, and pass!</l>

<l>Rich in gold of setting suns, where dance</l>
<l>Slim sylphs in silken draperies, who glance</l>
<l>With luring elfish eyes as they flit away—</l>
<l>Their white limbs  twinkling in  the gloom ;</l>

<l>Of rest, or hear no inner voice that sings;</l>

<l>Or feel the fluttering of angel wings.</l>

<l>Sheltering around,—but only Death</l>

<l>Leering in War's hideous company</l>

<l>With gorged Destruction, Lust and Misery !</l>

<l>In some dim woodland grove, and dreaming, chase</l>
<l>In rich-hued phantasy, all loveliness</l>
<l>Of perfume, form, and sound ; and wake to see</l>

<l>Out-stretched to grip me !</l>

<l>Oh ! how can I pen sweet songs</l>
<l>On noble themes, when all I see belongs</l>
<l>To hell ?   War is no glorious, cleansing thing ;</l>

<l>SOUNDS  BY  NIGHT</l>

<l>I hear the dull, low thunder of the guns</l>
<l>Beyond the hills that doze uneasily,</l>
<l>A sullen doomful growl that ever runs</l>
<l>From end to end of the heavy freighted sky ;</l>
<l>-A friend of mine writes, squatted on the floor.</l>
<l>And scrapes by yellow spluttering candle light.</l>
<l>" Ah ! hush ! " he breathes, and gazes at the door</l>
<l>That creeks on rusty hinge, in pale affright.</l>
<l>(No words spoke he, nor I, for well we knew</l>
<l>What rueful things these sounds did tell.)</l>
<l>A pause—I hear the trees sway sighing thro'</l>
<l>The gloom, like dismal moan of hollow knell.</l>
<l>Then out across the dark, and startling me</l>
<l>Bursts forth a laugh, a shout of drunken glee !</l>

<l>43</l>

<l>THE GAFF</l>

<l>Out, out into the wind-swept cleansing night</l>
<l>Whose purple canopy, the sky, is bright</l>
<l>With the soft splendour of the full round moon</l>
<l>And a thousand stars that mystically croon</l>
<l>Strange melodies upborne on the cooling wind !</l>
<l>Out into the night I plunge, my fevered mind</l>
<l>Hot and drunk.</l>

<l>Out to the night from the stenches</l>
<l>Of a swelt'ring music-hall where leering wenches,</l>
<l>Sickly pale, nudge lustfully in glee the men</l>
<l>That smoke and sweat in their music-den</l>
<l>Like bestial things; where the reeking pit</l>
<l>Vomits out its noise of ribald wit,</l>

<l>THE  GAFF</l>

<l>Where bloated men swill nauseous beer;</l>
<l>Its drunken babbling, oaths, hysteric glee.</l>
<l>Licentious talk and loathsome waggery;</l>
<l>Where huddled men and women sit in swarms.</l>
<l>All sensual and sweating all, on forms</l>
<l>Above a spittle-littered floor ;  and where</l>
<l>Tall men with silent philosophic air</l>
<l>Y-clad in tawdry braided gold, spit out</l>
<l>Tobacco juice and, watching, prowl about!</l>
<l>Out from the garish stage flashed bright with lights</l>
<l>That lure the eyes of the sweating crowd to sights</l>
<l>And things they lust for, women showing legs.</l>
<l>And more (like that fat girl, half nude, that begs</l>
<l>Her languid lover's ravishing embrace</l>

<l>Full-limbed, tight-laced wantons singing all</l>

<l>Out I rush to the night</l>
<l>Whose purple covering, the sky, is bright</l>
<l>With the soft splendour of a million stars</l>
<l>And the mystic moon.   Out, out, to list to bars</l>
<l>Of delicious music mingled with the scent</l>
<l>Of hidden flowers, that surely ne'er was meant</l>
<l>For man !   Out, out, to wash my jaded soul</l>
<l>With cooling airs from the star-wrought purple bowl</l>

<l>THE  GAFF</l>

<l>Of night, in the vast solemnity</l>

<l>Of silent trees where purple shadows lie</l>

<l>With golden withered leaves, a brook bewitched</l>

<l>By the elfish spell of moonbeams babbles on</l>

<l>And mutters of a silent graceful swan</l>

<l>It loves ;  and where, upon the whispering grass</l>

<l>Slim fairy dancers laugh and, twinkling, pass!</l>
