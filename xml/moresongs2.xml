            <p>"A little volume to treasure  contains poems that will become
classics."—Daily Mail.</p>

            <p>"This volume, compiled with admirable taste and discrimination by
Mr. Galloway Kyle, is the work of soldiers who are also singers. How
sweet their song it needs but a cursory glance through its pages to
reveal. The poems are the reflections of various temperaments, but
they are all informed by the spirit of a high resolve and a dauntless
courage. There is here, too, a certain gaiety of mood which, by some
strange paradox, appears to be one of the compensations of a soldier's
life. Some of these men are now numbered with the slain, but they
have bequeathed to posterity a priceless legacy of song."—New Witness.</p>

            <p>Dr. Hugh Walker, Professor of Literature and Philosophy at St.
David's College, Lampeter, in the Welsh Outlook:—</p>

            <p>"<title>Soldier Poets</title> is nearly always distinctly good, and sometimes it
comes near to being great poetry. Certainly the spirit that it shows is
great; There are not infrequent technical flaws: how could it be
otherwise when some, probably many, of the pieces were composed in



<pb/>



the trenches? But there is the stark sincerity of purpose, the flawless
truth which has been the essence of great art ever since art arose among
men. Though sonje of the pieces are faulty, they are all tingling with
vitality. They are in touch with reality, yet are nobly free from that
realism which thinks a stench more real than a perfume, and the
polluted slime vvhere a river rolls to the sea through some great city
more real than the infinite ocean beyond.</p>

            <p>"These poems from the land of the sights and smells of death are as
wholesome as a new-mown hayfield. And they are so because the
realities the soldiers have fixed their eyes upon are the great realities
of life and death. 'I have tried to picture some thoughts that pass
through a man's brain when he dies,' writes Streets—alas! 'Wounded
and missing, July, 1916.' The man who so tries can never do ignobly.
The vision Streets sees is a reality more enduring than the stench or
the slime. It is Youth thrilling to give for Liberty ' its love, its hope,
its radiant morn.'</p>

            <p>"The soldiers always have something particular to say; sometimes,
we may be sure, they could not rest until it was said.   Let us end with
Captain Grenfell's fine picture of the soldier going into battle.
This is religio militis—not the least noble variety of religion."</p>

            <p>"To read these poems by men of all ranks in the British Army is
to weep. But let not the reader deceive himself by tears. It is easy
to weep—and feel safe. Tears will little avail us who profit by the
brotherly sacrifice of these splendid youths if our emotions do not react
in effort.       The soldier poet never dwells on horror for horror's
sake. He knows what life is, and he finds in it beauty and love even
in the depths of pain. The old style of soldier was inarticulate.
Poets as far apart as Tennyson and Kipling tried to sing for him. They
sang well, but the poverty of their effort can only be measured by such
wonderful soldier verses as these. When the soldier himself sings
there is no flamboyance, no mock heroic. He uses a language simple,
direct, sweet. . Here is the secret of the soldier's spirit. We who
cannot fight may be envoisu to learn this secret, but it means travelling
by a hard road.      These men have found the realm beyond the
physical."—The New East (Tokyo).</p>

            <p>The national spirit would be fortified if every adult and every
adolescent were acquainted with this book. Order it now and see that
every friend and every school knows about it. A big Public School
edition is in preparation.</p>

            <head rend="center">Preface</head>

            <p>AN Introduction to this second series of "Soldier
Poets" is superfluous. What was said by way of
Foreword to the original volume is equally true of its
successor. There is the less need for repetition because
that original Introduction and the poems that followed
have been the text of many articles, sermons, and speeches,
including an address by the President of the Board of
Education, who allows us to paraphrase his remarks on
the characteristic features, already noted, of the remark-
able outburst of lyrical poetry from the seat of war.
The poems are remarkedly individual, he pointed out:
they are entirely free from hate and execration. There
is no reviling of the enemy. Our young soldiers look to
poetry as a deliverance from the grim necessities of the
hour rather than as a nieans of expressing martial emotion.
They do not gush concerning patriotism, but they feel it
none the less, and express it soberly, seriously, and with
intense conviction.
</p>

            <p>The same characteristics, the same yearning over the
beloved country left behind and of tender feeling for
parents and home, are found in all the poems that have
come to us from men in the fighting forces since the
former volume was collected. And here we may repeat,
that while these volumes are typical of the lyrical efflores-
cence of the fighting men, they do not pretend to be
exhaustive: the larger task of sifting already published
work and compiling a more complete anthology has been
undertaken by a devoted advocate of the significance of
the soldier poets' work and its claim to recognition.
</p>

            <pb n="8"/>

            <p>We builded better than we knew when we issued the
original volume as the climax of our proud association
with the soldier poets: it was a greater thing than we
were then aware of. No literary work of our day has
possessed so much genetic force or been of greater in-
fluence. It was well said that "Soldier Poets" was of
greater service to the Allied cause in America than many
Blue Books and specially prepared statements: it showed
the high clean spirit of ardent, generous youth engaged
on a new Crusade. These songs before sunrise gave fresh
vitality to poetry and were welcomed by a nation on
the eve of rebirth as the promise of a greater intensity
of living, a finer perception of beauty, a clearer vision of
the undying splendour after the weary days in which life
and art had become dreary and meaningless to the multi-
tude. Now the birth-throes have become more severe,
the spiritual quickening more accentuated, more and
more of the poems are personal threnodies, and the
sentinel graves of the Poetry Review young men who
responded to the call in 1914 now consecrate the long
line from Nieuport to Basra. They are a more glorious
and more numerous company than the Elizabethans, with
whom, in the great comradeship beyond the grave, they
still march, an invisible army, with their brothers-in-
arms who continue the material and spiritual warfare
here in the flesh, inspiring and directing the fight that
will not end with the war.</p>

                  <l>Upon the barrenness that war hath wrought,</l>
                  <l>Another vision rises in a haze</l>
                  <l>Of phantasy—I see a place of rest</l>
                  <l>All bathed in sunlight and the scent of flowers,</l>
                  <l>Where Time has fall'n asleep on Nature's breast,</l>
                  <l>And none may mark the. tread of passing hours.</l>
                  <l>And in the fairest part of all, that seems</l>
                  <l>The very home of all things pure and good,</l>
                  <l>A woman sits with half-closed eyes, and dreams</l>
                  <l>In ecstasy of perfect motherhood.</l>
                  <l>O wondrous mystery! Behold, the earth</l>
                  <l>Blossoms again in mystic second birth.</l>

combat in France on August 21 st, 1917, aged 19 years. He had
only been twelve days in France, being selected for a fighting
squadron three days after he landed. His squadron commander
described him as having already proved "a brilliant pilot," and
of his last air fight that "he fought bravely to a noble end." He
fell in our lines and is buried at Bailleul. The Belgium sonnets
were written in 1915 while he was a boy at Marlborough.</note>

                  <l>FROM clay in strength our native oak-tree grows</l>
                  <l>To height and girth and spread of largest span;</l>
                  <l>The sweet and crimson riot of the rose;</l>
                  <l>And wheat, the bread and sacrament of man.</l>
                  <l>Clay built our homes, and towns of civil folk</l>
                  <l>Where born were manners, arts and liberty;</l>
                  <l>Clay are the pipes whence age can blow but smoke.</l>
                  <l>And children orbs of bliss and vanity.</l>
                  <l>This is fine clay: our common clay is finer</l>
                  <l>Which England mine hath modelled not in strife</l>
                  <l>To strive for England, and the Great Designer</l>
                  <l>Into the nostrils breathed the breath of life.</l>
                  <l>Claye, I salute what everlasting fame</l>
                  <l>Informs thine ancient and illustrious name.</l>

                  <l>THEY'RE bringing in their recent dead—their</l>
                  <l>recent dead!</l>
                  <l>I see the shoulder badge: a "Southern crush."</l>
                  <l>How small he looks—(O damn that singing thrush!)</l>
                  <l>Not give foot five from boots to battered head!</l>
                  <l>Give him a kindly burial, my friends,—</l>
                  <l>S much is due, when some such loyal life ends!</l>
                  <l>"For Country!" Ay, and so our brave do die:</l>
                  <l>Comrade unknown, good rest to you!—Good-bye!</l>

                  <l>They're bringing their recent dead!—No pomp,</l>
                  <l>no show:</l>
                  <l>A dingy khaki crowd—his friends, his own.</l>
                  <l>I, too, would like—(God, how that wind does</l>
                  <l>moan!)—</l>
                  <l>To be laid down by friends: it's sweetest so!</l>
                  <l>A young life, as I take it; just a lad—</l>
                  <l>(Hc.v cold it blows; and that grey sky, how sad!)—</l>
                  <l>And yet: "For Country"—so a man should die:</l>
                  <l>Comrade unknown, good rest to you!—Good-bye!</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>They're burying their dead!—I wonder now:</l>
                  <l>A wife?—or mother? Mother it must be—</l>
                  <l>In some trim home that fronts the English sea.</l>
                  <l>(A sea-coast country: that the badges show.)</l>

                  <l>"This, then, the garnered harvest of my years!"</l>
                  <l>And he? "For Country, dear, a man must die!"</l>
                  <l>Comrade unknown, good rest to you!—Good-bye!</l>

                  <l>It's reeded: he is buried! Comrade, sleep!</l>
                  <l>A wooden cross at your brave head will stand.</l>
                  <l>A cross of wood?  A Calvary!—The Land</l>
                  <l>For whose sake you laid down sweet life, will keep</l>
                  <l>Watch, lad, and ward that none may bring to shame.</l>
                  <l>That Name for which you died! "What's in a name"?—</l>
                  <l>England shall answer! Tou will hear Her cry:</l>
                  <l>" Well done, my own! my son—good rest: Good-</l>
                  <l>bye!"</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>NIGHT and night's menace: Death hath forged a dart</l>
                  <l>Of every moment's pause and stealthy pass:</l>
                  <l>Blind Terror reigns: darkly, as in a glass,</l>
                  <l>Man's wondering Soul beholds his fearful Heart,</l>
                  <l>And questions, and is shaken: and, apart.</l>
                  <l>Light Chance, the harlot-goddess, holding Mass,</l>
                  <l>Scatters her favours broadcast on the grass</l>
                  <l>As might a drunkard spill his wares in mart!</l>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Time and sweet Order have forsaken men.</l>
                  <l>So near Eternal seems the Night's foul sway:</l>
                  <l>We ask of Life: "Has Chaos come again.</l>
                  <l>With Ruin, and Confusion, and Decay? "</l>
                  <l>Yet slowly, surely darkness dies:  and then.</l>
                  <l>Out of the deep night's menace, dawns the Day!</l>
