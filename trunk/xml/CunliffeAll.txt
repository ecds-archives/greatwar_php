When last heard from, the author, who is a British officer, was on service at Khartoum.</note>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">B<hi rend="smallcaps">ehind</hi> us in vermilion state</l>
<l>The sun fell to the rustling sea,</l>
<l>The grey-green twilight came and went,</l>
<l>And night involved my friend and me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now Egypt donned her fairest robes</l>
<l>Of glimmering moonshine cool and clear:</l>
<l>No more we talked, and silently</l>
<l>Made o'er the waste to Abu Qir.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For, with the twilight, twilight dreams</l>
<l>Had come and borne our souls away,</l>
<l>Though still our bodies onward fared</l>
<l>Toward the palm-trees and the bay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And my companion now, I think,</l>
<l>With brother-artists once again</l>
<l>Was painting in the atelier,</l>
<l>Or down some dear Parisian lane</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="2"/>
<l>Was seeking with a motley throng</l>
<l>That well-remembered brasserie,</l>
<l>And Trilby, hanging on his arm,</l>
<l>Was laughing at him merrily.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I, ah, where was I? Afar</l>
<l>I'd flown to that enchanted shore,</l>
<l>Where o'er white-flashing waves the wind</l>
<l>From Donegal to Mullaghmore</l>
<l>Comes gallivanting bold and free --</l>
<l rend="indent">God grant again I there may be,</l>
<l rend="indent">At Mullaghmore, with Rosalind.</l></lg>

<l rend="italic">England's cheeky kid brother,</l>
<l rend="italic">Who bloodily assaulted your august elder</l>
<l rend="italic">At Bunker Hill and similar places</l>
<l rend="italic">(Not mentioned in our history books),</l>
<l rend="italic">What can I tell you of war or of peace?</l>

<l rend="italic">Bull Run, Gettysburg, Fredericksburg?</l>
<l rend="italic">Your million dead?</l>
<l rend="italic">Tell me,</l>
<l rend="italic">Was that the greatest time of your lives</l>
<l rend="italic">Or the most disastrous?</l>
<l rend="italic">Who knows? Not you; not I.</l>
<l rend="italic">Who can tell the end of this war?</l>
<l rend="italic">And say, brother Jonathan,</l>
<l rend="italic">D'you know what it's all about?</l>
<l rend="italic">Let me whisper you a secret -- we don't!</l>
<l rend="italic">We were all too fat with peace,</l>
<l rend="italic">Or perhaps we didn't quite know how good peace was,</l>
<l rend="italic">And so here we are,</l>
<l rend="italic">And we're going to win....</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It's fine to be a soldier,</l>
<l>To get accepted by the recruiting sergeant,</l>
<pb n="4"/>
<l>Be trained, fitted with a uniform and a gun,</l>
<l>Say good-bye to your girl,</l>
<l>And go off to the front</l>
<l>Whistling, "It's a long way to Tipperary."</l>
<l>It's good to march forty miles a day,</l>
<l>Carrying ninety-one pounds on your back,</l>
<l>To eat good coarse food, get blistered, tired out, wounded,</l>
<l>Thirst, starve, fight like a devil</l>
<l>(<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, like you an' me, Jonathan),</l>
<l>With the Maxims zip-zipping</l>
<l>And the shrapnel squealing,</l>
<l>And the howitzers rumbling like the traffic in Piccadilly.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Civilization? --</l>
<l>Jonathan, if you could hear them</l>
<l>Whistling the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Marching Through Georgia</hi>,</l>
<l>You'd want to go too.</l>
<l>Twenty thousand a day, Jonathan!</l>
<l>Perhaps you're more civilized just now than we are,</l>
<l>Perhaps we've only forgotten civilization for a moment,</l>
<l>Perhaps we're really fighting for peace.</l>
<l>And after all it will be more fun afterwards --</l>
<l>More fun for the poets and the painters --</l>
<l>When the cheering's all over</l>
<pb n="5"/>
<l>And the dead men buried</l>
<l>And the rest gone back to their jobs.</l>
<l>It'll be more fun for them to make their patterns,</l>
<l>Their word-patterns and color-patterns.</l>
<l>And after all, there is always war and always peace,</l>
<l>Always the war of the crowds,</l>
<l>Always the great peace of the arts.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Even now,</l>
<l>With the war beating in great waves overhead,</l>
<l>Beating and roaring like great winds and mighty waters,</l>
<l>The sea-gods still pattern the red seaweed fronds,</l>
<l>Still chip the amber into neck-chains</l>
<l>For Leucothea and Thetis.</l>
<l>Even now,</l>
<l>When the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> screams like a hurt woman,</l>
<l>And Paris -- grisette among cities -- trembles with fear,</l>
<l>The poets still make their music</l>
<l>Which nobody listens to,</l>
<l>Which hardly anyone ever listened to.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The great crowds go by,</l>
<l>Fighting over each other's bodies in peace-time,</l>
<l>Fighting over each other's bodies in war-time.</l>
<l>Something of the strife comes to them</l>
<l>In their little, high rock-citadel of art,</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>Where they hammer their dreams in gold and copper,</l>
<l>Where they cut them in pine-wood, in Parian stone, in wax,</l>
<l>Where they sing them in sweet bizarre words</l>
<l>To the sound of antiquated shrill instruments;</l>
<l>And they are happy.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The little rock-citadel of the artists</l>
<l>Is always besieged;</l>
<l>There, though they have beauty and silence,</l>
<l>They have always tears and hunger and despair.</l>
<l>But that little citadel has held out</l>
<l>Against all the wars of the world</l>
<l>Like England, brother Jonathan.</l>
<l>It will not fall during the great war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There is always war and always peace;</l>
<l>Always the war of the crowds,</l>
<l>Always the great peace of the arts.</l>

<l>Forsaken loves of faithless bees,</l>

<head rend="center">UNSER GOTT</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">T<hi rend="smallcaps">hey</hi> held a great prayer-service in Berlin,</l>
<l>And augured German triumph from some words</l>
<l>Said to be spoken by the Jewish God</l>
<l>To Gideon, which signified that He</l>
<l>Was staunchly partial to the Israelites.</l>
<l>The aisles were thronged; and in the royal box</l>
<l>(I had it from a tourist who was there,</l>
<l>Clutching her passport, anxious, like the rest),</l>
<l>There sat the Kaiser, looking "very sad."</l>
<l>And then they sang; she said it shook the heart.</l>
<l>The women sobbed; tears salted bearded lips</l>
<l>Unheeded; and my friend looked back and saw</l>
<l>A young girl crumple in her mother's arms.</l>
<l>They carried out a score of them, she said,</l>
<l>While German hearts, through bursting German throats</l>
<l>Poured out, <hi rend="italic">Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott!</hi></l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Yea, "Unser Gott! Our strength is <hi rend="italic">Unser</hi> Gott!</l>
<l>Not that light-minded Bon Dieu of France!")</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I think we all have made our God too small.</l>
<l>There was a young man, a good while ago,</l>
<pb n="12"/>
<l>Who taught that doctrine... but they murdered him</l>
<l>Because he wished to share the Jewish God</l>
<l>With other folk.</l>
<l rend="indent18">They are long-lived, these fierce</l>
<l>Old hating Gods of nations; but at last</l>
<l>There surely will be spilled enough of blood</l>
<l>To drown them all! The deeps of sea and air,</l>
<l>Of old the seat of gods, no more are safe,</l>
<l>For mines and monoplanes. The Germans, now,</l>
<l>Can surely find and rout the God of France</l>
<l>With Zeppelins, or some slim mother's son</l>
<l>Of Paris, or of Tours, or Brittany,</l>
<l>Can drop a bomb into the <hi rend="italic">Feste Burg</hi>,</l>
<l>And, having crushed the source of German strength,</l>
<l>Die happy in his blazing monoplane.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Sad jesting! If there be no God at all,</l>
<l>Save in the heart of man, why, even so --</l>
<l>Yea, all the more, -- since we must make our God,</l>
<l>Oh, let us make Him large enough for all,</l>
<l>Or cease to prate of Him! If kings must fight,</l>
<l>Let them fight for their glory, openly,</l>
<l>And plain men for their lands and for their homes,</l>
<l>And heady youths, who go to see the fun,</l>
<l>Blaspheme not God. True, maybe we might leave</l>
<l>The God of Germany to some poor frau</l>
<l>Who cannot go, who can but wait and mourn,</l>
<pb n="13"/>
<l>Except that she will teach Him to her sons --</l>
<l>A God quite scornful of the Slavic soul,</l>
<l>And much concerned to keep Alsace-Lorraine.</l>
<l>They should go godless, too -- the poor, benumbed</l>
<l>Crushed, anguished women, till their hearts can hold</l>
<l>A greater Comforter!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent22">(Yet it is hard</l>
<l>To make Him big enough! For me, I like</l>
<l>The English and the Germans and the French,</l>
<l>The Russians, too; and Servians, I should think,</l>
<l>Might well be very interesting to God.</l>
<l>But, do the best I may, my God is white,</l>
<l>And hardly takes a nigger seriously</l>
<l>This side of Africa. Not those, at least</l>
<l>Who steal my wood, and of a summer night</l>
<l>Keep me awake with shouting, where they sit</l>
<l>With monkey-like fidelity and glee</l>
<l>Grinding through their well-oiled sausage-mill --</l>
<l>The dead machinery of the white man's church --</l>
<l>Raw jungle-fervor, mixed with scraps sucked dry</l>
<l>Of Israel's old sublimities: not those.</l>
<l>And when they threaten us, the Higher Race,</l>
<l>Think you, which side is God's? Oh, let us pray</l>
<l>Lest blood yet spurt to wash that black skin white,</l>
<l>As now it flows because a German hates</l>
<l>A Cossack, and an Austrian a Serb!)</l>
<pb n="14"/>
<l>What was it that he said so long ago,</l>
<l>The young man who outgrew the Jewish God --</l>
<l>"Not a sparrow falleth --?" Ah, God, God,</l>
<l>And there shall fall a million murdered men!</l>

<head rend="center">The sky flowers</l>
<l>All day.</l>
<l>Strange mechanical birds</l>
<l>With struts of wire and glazed wings</l>
<l>Cross the impassive sky</l>
<l>Which burgeons ever and again</l>
<l>With ephemeral unfolding flowers,</l>
<l>White and yellow and brown,</l>
<l>That spread and dissolve.</l>
<l>And smaller rapid droning birds go by,</l>
<l>And bright metallic bees whose sting is death.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behind the hills,</l>
<l>Behind the whispering woods whose leaves are falling</l>
<l>Yellow and red to cover the red clay,</l>
<l>Misshapen monsters squat with wide black maws</l>
<l>Gulping smoke and belching flame.</l>
<l>From the mirk reed beds of the age of coal,</l>
<l>Wallowing out of their sleep in the earlier slime,</l>
<l>They are resurrected and stagger forth to slay --</l>
<l>The prehistoric Beasts we thought were dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="18"/>
<l>They are blinded with long sleep,</l>
<l>But men with clever weapons</l>
<l>Goad them to fresh pastures.</l>
<l>Beside still waters</l>
<l>They drink of blood and neigh a horrible laughter,</l>
<l>And their ponderous tread shakes happy cities down,</l>
<l>And the thresh of their flail-like tails</l>
<l>Makes acres smoulder and smoke</l>
<l>Blackened of golden harvest.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The Beasts are back,</l>
<l>And men, in their spreading shadow,</l>
<l>Inhale the odor of their nauseous breath.</l>
<l>Inebriate with it they fashion other gods</l>
<l>Than the gods of day-dream.</l>
<l>Of iron and steel are little images</l>
<l>Made of the Beasts.</l>
<l>And men rush forth and fling themselves for ritual</l>
<l>Before these gods, before the lumbering Beasts, --</l>
<l>And some make long obeisance.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Umber and violet flowers of the sky,</l>
<l>The sun, like a blazing Mars, clanks across the blue</l>
<l>And plucks you, to fashion into a nosegay</l>
<l>To offer Venus, his old-time paramour.</l>
<l>But now she shrinks</l>
<pb n="19"/>
<l>And pales</l>
<l>Like Cynthia, her more ascetic sister...</l>
<l>Vulcan came to her arms in the grimy garb</l>
<l>Of toil, he smelt of the forge and the racketing workshop,</l>
<l>But not of blood.</l>
<l>And, if she smells these flowers, they bubble ruby blood</l>
<l>That trickles between her fingers.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet is a dream flowing over the red country,</l>
<l>Yet is a light growing, for all the black furrows of the red country...</l>
<l>The machines are foe or friend</l>
<l>As the world desires.</l>
<l>The Beasts shall sleep again.</l>
<l>And in that sleep, when the land is twilight-still</l>
<l>And men take thought among the frozen waves of the dead,</l>
<l>The Sowers go forth once more,</l>
<l>Sowers of vision, sowers of the seed</l>
<l>Of peace or war.</l>
<l>Shall it be peace indeed?</l>
<l>Great shadowy figures moving from hill to hill</l>
<l>Of tangled bodies, with rhythmic stride and cowled averted head,</l>
<l>What do you sow with hands funereal --</l>
<l>New savageries imperial,</l>
<pb n="20"/>
<l>Unthinking pomps for arrogant, witless men?</l>
<l>Or seed for the people in strong democracy?</l>
<l>What do you see</l>
<l>With your secret eyes, and sow for us, that we must reap again?</l></lg>

<l n="1">I<hi rend="smallcaps">t</hi> is twelve years since I have been there --</l>
<l>I was born there,</l>
<l>In the little town, by the river --</l>
<l>It all comes back to me now</l>
<l>Reading in the newspaper:</l>
<l rend="italic">"The Germans have seized the bridge-head at Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za;</l>
<l rend="italic">The Russians are retreating in good order across the marshes;</l>
<l rend="italic">The town is in flames."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l>
<l>Sweet-sounding, time-scented name --</l>
<l>Smelling of wide-extending marshes of hay;</l>
<l>Smelling of cornfields;</l>
<l>Smelling of apple-orchards;</l>
<l>Smelling of cherry-trees in full blossom;</l>
<l>Smelling of all the pleasant recollections of my childhood --</l>
<l>Smelling of Grandmother's kitchen,</l>
<l>Grandmother's freshly-baked dainties,</l>
<l>Grandmother's plum-pudding --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="33"/>
<l>I see before me a lane running between two rows of straggling cottages --</l>
<l>I cannot remember the name of the lane;</l>
<l>I do not know whether it has any name at all;</l>
<l>But I remember it was broad and unpaven and shaded with wide-branching chestnuts --</l>
<l>And enters the market-place</l>
<l>Just a few houses after my Grandfather's --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see it even now</l>
<l>My Grandfather's house --</l>
<l>On the lane, to the right, as you come from the market-place;</l>
<l>A big, hospitable frame building --</l>
<l>Big like my Grandfather's own heart,</l>
<l>And hospitable like Grandmother's smile --</l>
<l>I can see it even now,</l>
<l>With the white-pillared porch in the centre and the sharp-gabled roof</l>
<l>Pierced with little windows;</l>
<l>And the great quadrangular garden behind it;</l>
<l>And the tall fence surrounding the garden;</l>
<l>And the old well in the corner of the garden;</l>
<l>With the bucket-lift</l>
<l>Rising over the fence --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="34"/>
<l>I can see him even now,</l>
<l>My Grandfather --</l>
<l>Bending over me, tall and sad-eyed and thoughtful</l>
<l>Lifting me up and seating me on his knees</l>
<l>Lovingly,</l>
<l>And listening to all my childish questions and confessions;</l>
<l>Pardoning, admonishing, remonstrating --</l>
<l>Satisfying my interrogative soul with good-humored indulgence --</l>
<l>And my Grandmother,</l>
<l>Dear little woman!</l>
<l>I can never dissociate her from plum-pudding and apple dumplings,</l>
<l>And raisin-cakes and almond cakes and crisp potato pancakes</l>
<l>And the smell of fish frying on the fire --</l>
<l>And then there is my cousin, Miriam,</l>
<l>Who lived in the yellow house across the lane --</l>
<l>A freckle-faced, cherry-eyed little girl with a puckered-up nose.</l>
<l>I was very romantic about her;</l>
<l>And then there is my curse, my rival at school, my arch-enemy --</l>
<l>Jacob,</l>
<l>The synagogue sexton's boy,</l>
<l>On whom 1 was always warring --</l>
<pb n="35"/>
<l>God knows on what battlefield he must be lying now!</l>
<l>And then there is Nathan and Joseph and Berel and Solomon</l>
<l>And Ephraim, the baker's boy,</l>
<l>And Baruch and Gershen and Mendel</l>
<l>And long-legged, sandy-haired Emanuel who fell into the pond with me that time,</l>
<l>While we were skating on the ice --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see myself even now</l>
<l>In the lane on a summer's day,</l>
<l>Cap in hand, chasing after dragon-flies --</l>
<l>Suddenly, near by, sounds the noise of drums and bugles --</l>
<l>I know what that means!</l>
<l>Breathlessly I dash up the lane --</l>
<l>It is the regiment quartered in the barracks at the end of the town, in its annual parade on the highway --</l>
<l>How I would wish to be one of those gray-coated heroes!</l>
<l>I watch them eager-eyed --</l>
<l>And run after them until they reach the Gentile Quarter --</l>
<l>And then I turn back --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="36"/>
<l>I am in the market-place --</l>
<l>At a Fair;</l>
<l>The market-place is a heaving mass of carts and horses and oxen;</l>
<l>The oxen are lowing, the horses are neighing, the peasants are cursing in a dozen different dialects --</l>
<l>I am in Grandfather's store,</l>
<l>On the lower end of the market-place, right opposite the public well --</l>
<l>The store is full of peasants and peasant women, bargaining at the top of their voices;</l>
<l>The men are clad in rough sheepskin coats and fur caps;</l>
<l>The women are gay in bright-colored cottons and wear red kerchiefs around their heads;</l>
<l>My Grandfather is standing behind the counter measuring out rope to some peasants;</l>
<l>Grandmother is cutting a strip of linen for a peasant woman, chaffering with another one at the same time, about the price of a pair of sandals --</l>
<l>And I am sitting there, behind the counter, on a sack of flour,</l>
<l>Playing with my black-eyed little cousin --</l></lg>

<head rend="center">When the war was over</l>
<l>Came the young men slowly with an air of being old,</l>
<l>On a morning blue and gold</l>
<l>Through the weed-grown meadow-places</l>
<l>Marched young soldiers with old faces,</l>
<l>Marched the columns of the Emperor with dull, bewildered eyes,</l>
<l>And the day was like a rose upon the skies;</l>
<l>But they feared both light and life,</l>

<lg>
<l>A woman knelt in a garden by the road,</l>
<l rend="indent">Patting a little mound of earth</l>
<l>With aimless hands. Along the highway flowed</l>
<l rend="indent">The gray tide, while the day was at its birth.</l>
<l>She heard the drums, looked up, half smiled:</l>
<l rend="indent">"Why do you march," she said, "and play at soldiers?</l>

<l>There's none to laugh at you -- no little child!</l>

<l rend="indent">Old men grouped by their fright, ran here and there</l>
<l>In startled herds, with shrill unmeaning cries.</l>
<l rend="indent">And there was white in every woman's hair,</l>
<l>And when a window yielded them a face</l>
<l rend="indent">'Twas like a flower blasted by the sun;</l>

<l>The world seemed robbed of joyousness and grace,</l>

<l rend="indent">With hands unearthly slow,</l>
<l>As though her toil must be</l>
<l>The very measure of eternity.</l>
<l>A boy ran from the ranks, stooped, touched her brow;</l>
<l rend="italic">"Margot, Margot! Is it thou?"</l>
<l>She did not glance up at the white-faced lad.</l>

<l>Before the palace gate, in cloak and crown,</l>
<l>A shriveled figure sat with shaking hands,</l>
<l>Forming toy soldiers into various bands.</l>
<l>A figure in a jeweled diadem,</l>
<l rend="indent">Who, as the swords leaped with a ringing noise,</l>
