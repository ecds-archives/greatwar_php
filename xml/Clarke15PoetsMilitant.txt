<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcaps">have</hi> a rendezvous with Death</l>
<l>At some disputed barricade,</l>
<l>When Spring comes back with rustling shade</l>
<l>And apple-blossoms fill the air --</l>
<l>I have a rendezvous with Death</l>
<l>When Spring brings back blue days and fair.</l></lg>

<l>It may be he shall take my hand</l>
<l>And lead me into his dark land</l>
<l>And close my eyes and quench my breath --</l>

<l>I have a rendezvous with Death</l>
<l>On some scarred slope of battered hill,</l>
<l>When Spring comes round again this year</l>
<l>And the first meadow-flowers appear.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>God knows 't were better to be deep</l>
<l>Pillowed in silk and scented down,</l>
<l>Where love throbs out in blissful sleep,</l>
<l>Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,</l>
<l>Where hushed awakenings are dear...</l>
<l>But I've a rendezvous with Death</l>
<l>At midnight in some flaming town,</l>
<l>When Spring trips north again this year,</l>
<l>And I to my pledged word am true,</l>
<l>I shall not fail that rendezvous.</l></lg>

<l>Toiling at ledgers in a city grey,</l>
<l>Thinking that so his days would drift away</l>
<l>With no lance broken in life's tournament:</l>
<l>Yet ever 'twixt the books and his bright eyes</l>
<l>The gleaming eagles of the legions came,</l>
<l>And horsemen, charging under phantom skies,</l>
<l>Went thundering past beneath the oriflamme.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now those waiting dreams are satisfied;</l>
<l>From twilight to the halls of dawn he went;</l>
<l>His lance is broken; but he lies content</l>
<l>With that high hour, in which he lived and died.</l>
<l>And falling thus he wants no recompense,</l>
<l>Who found his battle in the last resort;</l>
<l>Nor needs he any hearse to bear him hence,</l>
<l>Who goes to join the men of Agincourt.</l></lg>

<l>And when the burning moment breaks,</l>

<l>That it be not the Destined Will.</l></lg>

<l>The thundering line of battle stands,</l>
<l>And in the air Death moans and sings:</l>

<l n="1">N<hi rend="smallcaps">o</hi> Man's Land is an eerie sight</l>
<l>At early dawn in the pale gray light.</l>
<l>Never a house and never a hedge</l>
<l>In No Man's Land from edge to edge,</l>
<pb n="159"/>
<l>And never a living soul walks there</l>
<l>To taste the fresh of the morning air; --</l>
<l>Only some lumps of rotting clay,</l>
<l>That were friends or foemen yesterday.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What are the bounds of No Man's Land?</l>
<l>You can see them clearly on either hand,</l>
<l>A mound of rag-bags gray in the sun,</l>
<l>Or a furrow of brown where the earthworks run</l>
<l>From the eastern hills to the western sea,</l>
<l>Through field or forest o'er river and lea;</l>
<l>No man may pass them, but aim you well</l>
<l>And Death rides across on the bullet or shell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But No Man's Land is a goblin sight</l>
<l>When patrols crawl over at dead o' night;</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Boche</hi> or British, Belgian or French,</l>
<l>You dice with death when you cross the trench.</l>
<l>When the "rapid," like fireflies in the dark,</l>
<l>Flits down the parapet spark by spark,</l>
<l>And you drop for cover to keep your head</l>
<l>With your face on the breast of the four months' dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The man who ranges in No Man's Land</l>
<l>Is dogged by the shadows on either hand</l>
<l>When the star-shell's flare, as it bursts o'erhead,</l>
<l>Scares the gray rats that feed on the dead,</l>
<l>And the bursting bomb or the bayonet-snatch</l>
<l>May answer the click of your safety-catch,</l>
<l>For the lone patrol, with his life in his hand,</l>
<l>Is hunting for blood in No Man's Land.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I<hi rend="smallcaps">n</hi> the glad revels, in the happy f&ecirc;tes,</l>
<l>When cheeks are flushed, and glasses gilt and pearled</l>
<l>With the sweet wine of France that concentrates</l>
<l>The sunshine and the beauty of the world,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Drink sometimes, you whose footsteps yet may tread</l>
<l>The undisturbed, delightful paths of Earth,</l>
<l>To those whose blood, in pious duty shed,</l>
<l>Hallows the soil where that same wine had birth.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Here, by devoted comrades laid away,</l>
<l>Along our lines they slumber where they fell,</l>
<l>Beside the crater at the Ferme d'Alger</l>
<l>And up the bloody slopes of La Pompelle,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And round the city whose cathedral towers</l>
<l>The enemies of Beauty dared profane,</l>
<l>And in the mat of multicolored flowers</l>
<l>That clothe the sunny chalk-fields of Champagne.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Under the little crosses where they rise</l>
<l>The soldier rests. Now round him undismayed</l>
<l>The cannon thunders, and at night he lies</l>
<l>At peace beneath the eternal fusillade...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>That other generations might possess --</l>
<l>From shame and menace free in years to come --</l>
<l>A richer heritage of happiness,</l>
<l>He marched to that heroic martyrdom.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Esteeming less the forfeit that he paid</l>
<l>Than undishonored that his flag might float</l>
<pb n="161"/>
<l>Over the towers of liberty, he made</l>
<l>His breast the bulwark and his blood the moat.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Obscurely sacrificed, his nameless tomb,</l>
<l>Bare of the sculptor's art, the poet's lines,</l>
<l>Summer shall flush with poppy-fields in bloom,</l>
<l>And Autumn yellow with maturing vines.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There the grape-pickers at their harvesting</l>
<l>Shall lightly tread and load their wicker trays,</l>
<l>Blessing his memory as they toil and sing</l>
<l>In the slant sunshine of October days...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I love to think that if my blood should be</l>
<l>So privileged to sink where his has sunk,</l>
<l>I shall not pass from Earth entirely,</l>
<l>But when the banquet rings, when healths are drunk,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And faces that the joys of living fill</l>
<l>Glow radiant with laughter and good cheer,</l>
<l>In beaming cups some spark of me shall still</l>
<l>Brim toward the lips that once I held so dear.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So shall one coveting no higher plane</l>
<l>Than nature clothes in color and flesh and tone,</l>
<l>Even from the grave put upward to attain</l>
<l>The dreams youth cherished and missed and might have known;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And that strong need that strove unsatisfied</l>
<l>Toward earthly beauty in all forms it wore,</l>
<l>Not death itself shall utterly divide</l>
<l>From the belov&egrave;d shapes it thirsted for.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="162"/>
<l>Alas, how many an adept for whose arms</l>
<l>Life held delicious offerings perished here,</l>
<l>How many in the prime of all that charms,</l>
<l>Crowned with all gifts that conquer and endear!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Honor them not so much with tears and flowers,</l>
<l>But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies,</l>
<l>Where in the anguish of atrocious hours</l>
<l>Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Rather when music on bright gatherings lays</l>
<l>Its tender spell, and joy is uppermost,</l>
<l>Be mindful of the men they were, and raise</l>
<l>Your glasses to them in one silent toast.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Drink to them -- - amorous of dear Earth as well,</l>
<l>They asked no tribute lovelier than this -- -</l>
<l>And in the wine that ripened where they fell,</l>
<l>Oh, frame your lips as though it were a kiss.</l></lg>

<l>Soldiers only know the street</l>
<l>Where the mud is churned and splashed about</l>
<l>By battle-wending feet;</l>
<l>And yet beside one stricken house there is a glimpse of grass --</l>
<l>Look for it when you pass.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Beyond the church whose pitted spire</l>
<l>Seems balanced on a strand</l>
<l>Of swaying stone and tottering brick,</l>
<l>Two roofless ruins stand;</l>
<l>And here, among the wreckage, where the back-wall should have been,</l>
<l>We found a garden green.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The grass was never trodden on,</l>
<l>The little path of gravel</l>
<l>Was overgrown with celandine;</l>
<l>No other folk did travel</l>
<l>Along its weedy surface but the nimble-footed mouse,</l>
<l>Running from house to house.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So all along the tender blades</l>
<l>Of soft and vivid grass</l>
<l>We lay, nor heard the limber wheels</l>
<l>That pass and ever pass</l>
<l>In noisy continuity until their stony rattle</l>
<l>Seems in itself a battle.</l></lg>

<pb n="165"/>
<lg>
<l>At length we rose up from this ease</l>
<l>Of tranquil happy mind,</l>
<l>And searched the garden's little length</l>
<l>Some new pleasaunce to find;</l>
<l>And there some yellow daffodils, and jasmine hanging high,</l>
<l>Did rest the tired eye.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The fairest and most fragrant</l>
<l>Of the many sweets we found</l>
<l>Was a little bush of Daphne flower</l>
<l>Upon a mossy mound,</l>
<l>And so thick were the blossoms set and so divine the scent,</l>
<l>That we were well content.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Hungry for Spring I bent my head,</l>
<l>The perfume fanned my face,</l>
<l>And all my soul was dancing</l>
<l>In that lovely little place,</l>
<l>Dancing with a measured step from wrecked and shattered towns</l>
<l>Away... upon the Downs.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I saw green banks of daffodil,</l>
<l>Slim poplars in the breeze,</l>
<l>Great tan-brown hares in gusty March</l>
<l>A-courting on the leas.</l>
<l>And meadows, with their glittering streams -- and silver-scurrying dace --</l>
<l>Home, what a perfect place!</l></lg>

<l>Was there grief once? Grief yet is mine.</l>

<l>With pleasure infinite,</l>
<l>And all the feathered wings of rest</l>
<l>Seem flocking from the radiant West</l>
<l>To bear me thro' the night.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>See, how they close me in,</l>
<l>They, and the sisters' arms.</l>
<l>One eye is closed, the other lid</l>
<l>Is watching how my spirit slid</l>
<l>Toward some red-roofed farms,</l>
<l>And having crept beneath them slept</l>
<l>Secure from war's alarms.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">O<hi rend="smallcaps">h</hi>! yon hills are filled with sunlight, and the green leaves paled to gold,</l>
<l>And the smoking mists of Autumn hanging faintly o'er the wold;</l>
<l>I dream of hills of other days whose sides I loved to roam</l>
<l>When Spring was dancing through the lanes of those distant hills of home.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The winds of heaven gathered there as pure and cold as dew;</l>
<l>Wood-sorrel and wild violets along the hedgerows grew,</l>
<pb n="184"/>
<l>The blossom on the pear-trees was as white as flakes of foam</l>
<l>In the orchard 'neath the shadow of those distant hills of home.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The first white frost in the meadow will be shining there to-day</l>
<l>And the furrowed upland glinting warm beside the woodland way;</l>
<l>There, a bright face and a clear hearth will be waiting when I come,</l>
<l>And my heart is throbbing wildly for those distant hills of home.</l></lg>
