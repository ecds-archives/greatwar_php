<head rend="center">Introduction</head>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Because</hi> man is both militant and pacific, he has expressed in literature, as indeed in the other forms of art, his pacific and militant moods. Nor are these moods, of necessity, incompatible. War may become the price of peace, and peace may so decay as inevitably to bring about war. Of the dully unresponsive pacifist and the jingo patriot, quick to anger, the latter no doubt is the more dangerous to the cause of true freedom, yet both are "undesirable citizens." He who believes that peace is illusory and spurious, unless it be based upon justice and liberty, will be proud to battle, if battle he must, for the sake of those foundations.</p>

<p>For the most part, the poetry of war, undertaken in this spirit, has touched and exalted such special qualities as patriotism, courage, self-sacrifice, enterprise, and endurance. Where it has tended to glorify war in itself, it is chiefly because war has released those qualities, so to speak, in stirring and spectacular ways; and where it has chosen to round upon war and to upbraid it, it is because war has slain ardent and lovable youths and has brought misery and despair to women and old people. But the war poet has left the mere arguments to others. For himself, he has seen and felt. Envisaging war from various angles, now romantically, now realistically, now as the celebrating chronicler, now as the contemplative interpreter, but always in a spirit of catholic curiosity, he has sung the 
<pb n="xxvi"/>
fall of Troy, the Roman adventures, the medi&#x00E6;val battles and crusades, the fields of Agincourt and Waterloo, and the more modern revolutions. Since Homer, he has spoken with martial eloquence through the voices of Drayton, Spenser, Marlowe, Webster, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Scott, Burns, Campbell, Tennyson, Browning, the New England group, and Walt Whitman, -- to mention only a few of the British and American names, -- and he speaks sincerely and powerfully to-day in the writings of Kipling, Hardy, Masefield, Binyon, Newbolt, Watson, Rupert Brooke, and the two young soldiers -- the one English, the other American -- who have lately lost their lives while on active service: Captain Charles Hamilton Sorley, who was killed at Hulluch, October 18, 1915; and Alan Seeger, who fell, mortally wounded, during the charge on Belloy-en-Santerre, July 4, 1916.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these several minds and spirits, stirred by the passion and energy of war, and reacting sensitively both to its cruelties and to its pities, have experienced the kinship of quickened insight and finer unselfishness in the face of wide-ranging death. They have silently compared, perhaps, the normal materialistic conventions in business, politics, education, and religion, with the relief from those conventions that nearly all soldiers and many civilians experience in time of war; for although war has its too gross and ugly side, it has not dared to learn that inflexibility of custom and conduct that deadens the spirit into a tame submission. This strange rebound and exaltation would seem to be due less to the physical reality of war -- which must in many ways cramp and constrain the individual -- than to the relative spirit
<pb n="xxvii"/>
ual freedom engendered by the needs of war, if they are to be successfully met. The man of war has an altogether unusual opportunity to realize himself, to cleanse and heal himself through the mastering of his physical fears; through the facing of his moral doubts; through the re&#x00EB;xamination of whatever thoughts he may have possessed, theretofore, about life and death and the universe; and through the quietly unselfish devotion he owes to the welfare of his fellows and to the cause of his native land.</p>

<p>Into the stuff of his thought and utterance, whether he be on active service or not, the poet-interpreter of war weaves these intentions, and co&#x00F6;perates with his fellows in building up a little higher and better, from time to time, that edifice of truth for whose completion can be spared no human experience, no human hope.</p>

<p>As already suggested, English and American literatures have both received genuine accessions, even thus early, arising out of the present great conflict, and we may be sure that other equally notable contributions will be made. The present Anthology contains a number of representative poems produced by English-speaking men and women. The editorial policy has been humanly hospitable, rather than academically critical, especially in the case of some of the verses written by soldiers at the Front, which, however slight in certain instances their technical merit may be, are yet psychologically interesting as sincere transcripts of personal experience, and will, it is thought, for that very reason, peculiarly attract and interest the reader. It goes without saying that there are several poems in this group which conspicuously suc
<pb n="xxviii"/>
ceed also as works of art. For the rest, the attempt has been made, within such limitations as have been experienced, to present pretty freely the best of what has been found available in contemporary British and American war verse. It must speak for itself, and the reader will find that in not a few instances it does so with sensitive sympathy and with living power; sometimes, too, with that quietly intimate companionableness which we find in Gray's <hi rend="italic">Elegy</hi>, and which John Masefield, while lecturing in America in 1916, so often indicated as a prime quality in English poetry. But if this quality appears in Chaucer and the pre-Romantics and Wordsworth, it appears also in Longfellow and Lowell, in Emerson and Lanier, and in William Vaughn Moody; for American poetry is, after all, as English poetry, -- "with a difference," -- sprung from the same sources, and coursing along similar channels.</p>

<p>The new fellowship of the two great Anglo-Saxon nations which a book of this character may, to a degree, illustrate, is filled with such high promise for both of them, and for all civilization, that it is perhaps hardly too much to say, with Ambassador Walter H. Page, in his address at the Pilgrims' Dinner in London, April 12, 1917: "We shall get out of this association an indissoluble companionship, and we shall henceforth have indissoluble mutual duties for mankind. I doubt if there could be another international event comparable in large value and in long consequences to this closer association." Mr. Balfour struck the same note, when, during his mission to the United States, he expressed himself in these words: "That this great people should throw themselves whole-heartedly into this mighty struggle, prepared for all efforts and sac
<pb n="xxix"/>
rifices that may be required to win success for this most righteous cause, is an event at once so happy and so momentous that only the historian of the future will be able, as I believe, to measure its true proportions."</p>

<p>The words of these eminent men ratify in the field of international politics the hopeful anticipation which Tennyson expressed in his poem, <hi rend="italic">Hands all Round</hi>, which first appeared in the London <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, February 7, 1852: --

<l>Should war's mad blast again be blown,</l>
<l rend="indent">Permit not thou the tyrant powers</l>

<l rend="indent">But let thy broadsides roar with ours.</l>

</q>

They ratify also the spirit of those poems in the present volume which seek to interpret to Britons and Americans their deepening friendship. "Poets," said Shelley, "are the unacknowledged legislators of the world," and he meant by legislation the guidance and determination of the verdicts of the human soul.</p>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">It</hi> is portentous, and a thing of state</l>
<l>That here at midnight, in our little town,</l>
<l>A mourning figure walks, and will not rest,</l>
<l>Near the old court-house pacing up and down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards</l>
<l>He lingers where his children used to play;</l>
<l>Or through the market, on the well-worn stones</l>
<l>He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black,</l>
<l>A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl</l>

<l>The prairie-lawyer, master of us all.</l></lg>

<lg>

<l>He is among us: -- as in times before!</l>
<l>And we who toss and lie awake for long</l>
<l>Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.</l></lg>

<l>His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings.</l>
<l>Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?</l>
<l>Too many peasants fight, they know not why,</l>
<l>Too many homesteads in black terror weep.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.</l>

<l>It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcap">saw</hi> her first abreast the Boston Light</l>
<l>At anchor; she had just come in, turned head,</l>
<l>And sent her hawsers creaking, clattering down.</l>
<l>I was so near to where the hawse-pipes fed</l>
<l>The cable out from her careening bow,</l>
<l>I moved up on the swell, shut steam and lay</l>
<l>Hove to in my old launch to look at her.</l>
<l>She'd come in light, a-skimming up the Bay</l>
<l>Like a white ghost with topsails bellying full;</l>
<l>And all her noble lines from bow to stern</l>
<l>Made music in the wind; it seemed she rode</l>
<l>The morning air like those thin clouds that turn</l>
<l>Into tall ships when sunrise lifts the clouds</l>
<l>From calm sea-courses.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There, in smoke-smudged coats,</l>
<l>Lay funnelled liners, dirty fishing-craft,</l>
<l>Blunt cargo-luggers, tugs, and ferry-boats.</l>
<l>Oh, it was good in that black-scuttled lot</l>
<l>To see the <hi rend="italic">Frye</hi> come lording on her way</l>
<pb n="8"/>
<l>Like some old queen that we had half forgot</l>
<l>Come to her own. A little up the Bay</l>
<l>The Fort lay green, for it was springtime then;</l>
<l>The wind was fresh, rich with the spicy bloom</l>
<l>Of the New England coast that tardily</l>
<l>Escapes, late April, from an icy tomb.</l>
<l>The State-house glittered on old Beacon Hill,</l>
<l>Gold in the sun.... 'T was all so fair awhile;</l>
<l>But she was fairest -- this great square-rigged ship</l>
<l>That had blown in from some far happy isle</l>
<l>On from the shores of the Hesperides.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They caught her in a South Atlantic road</l>
<l>Becalmed, and found her hold brimmed up with wheat;</l>
<l>"Wheat's contrabrand," they said, and blew her hull</l>
<l>To pieces, murdered one of our staunch fleet,</l>
<l>Fast dwindling, of the big old sailing ships</l>
<l>That carry trade for us on the high sea</l>
<l>And warped out of each harbor in the States.</l>
<l>It was n't law, so it seems strange to me --</l>
<l>A big mistake. Her keel's struck bottom now</l>
<l>And her four masts sunk fathoms, fathoms deep</l>
<l>To Davy Jones. The dank seaweed will root</l>
<l>On her oozed decks, and the cross-surges sweep</l>
<l>Through the set sails; but never, never more</l>
<l>Her crew will stand away to brace and trim,</l>
<l>Nor sea-blown petrels meet her thrashing up</l>
<l>To windward on the Gulf Stream's stormy rim;</l>
<l>Never again she'll head a no'theast gale</l>
<l>Or like a spirit loom up, sliding dumb,</l>
<l>And ride in safe beyond the Boston Light,</l>
<l>To make the harbor glad because she's come.</l></lg>

<l>Thought, as it were an old stringed instrument</l>
<l>Drawn to remembered music, oft does set</l>
<l>The lips moving in prayer, for us fresh keeping</l>
<l>Knowledge of springtime and the violet.</l></lg>

<pb n="12"/>
<lg>
<l>And, as the eyes grow dim with many years,</l>
<l>The spirit runs more swiftly than the feet,</l>
<l>Perceives its comfort, knows that it will meet</l>
<l>God at the end of troubles, that the dreary</l>
<l>Last reaches of old age lead beyond tears</l>
<l>To happy youth unending. There is peace</l>
<l>In homeward waters, where at last the weary</l>
<l>Shall find rebirth, and their long struggle cease.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So, at this hour, when the Old World lies sick,</l>
<l>Beyond the pain, the agony of breath</l>
<l>Hard drawn, beyond the menaces of death,</l>
<l>O'er graves and years leans out the eager spirit.</l>
<l>First must the ancient die; then shall be quick</l>
<l>New fires within us. Brother, we shall make</l>
<l>Incredible discoveries and inherit</l>
<l>The fruits of hope, and love shall be awake.</l></lg>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Often</hi> I think of you, Jimmy Doane,</l>
<l>You who, lightheartedly, came to my house</l>
<l>Three autumns, to shoot and to eat a grouse!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As I sat apart in this quiet room,</l>
<l>My mind was full of the horror of war</l>
<l>And not with the hope of a visitor.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I had dined on food that had lost its taste;</l>
<l>My soul was cold and I wished you were here, --</l>
<l>When, all in a moment, I knew you were near.</l></lg>

<pb n="15"/>
<lg>
<l>Placing that chair where you used to sit,</l>
<l>I looked at my book: -- Three years to-day</l>
<l>Since you laughed in that seat and I heard you say --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"My country is with you, whatever befall:</l>
<l>America -- Britain -- these two are akin</l>
<l>In courage and honour; they underpin</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"The rights of Mankind!" Then you grasped my hand</l>
<l>With a brotherly grip, and you made me feel</l>
<l>Something that Time would surely reveal.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>You were comely and tall; you had corded arms,</l>
<l>And sympathy's grace with your strength was blent;</l>
<l>You were generous, clever, and confident.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There was that in your hopes which uncountable lives</l>
<l>Have perished to make; your heart was fulfilled</l>
<l>With the breath of God that can never be stilled.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A living symbol of power, you talked</l>
<l>Of the work to do in the world to make</l>
<l>Life beautiful: yes, and my heartstrings ache</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>To think how you, at the stroke of War,</l>
<l>Chose that your steadfast soul should fly</l>
<l>With the eagles of France as their proud ally.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>You were America's self, dear lad --</l>
<l>The first swift son of your bright, free land</l>
<l>To heed the call of the Inner Command --</l></lg>

<pb n="16"/>
<lg>
<l>To image its spirit in such rare deeds</l>
<l>As braced the valour of France, who knows</l>
<l>That the heart of America thrills with her woes.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For a little leaven leavens the whole!</l>
<l>Mostly we find, when we trouble to seek</l>
<l>The soul of a people, that some unique,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Brave man is its flower and symbol, who</l>
<l>Makes bold to utter the words that choke</l>
<l>The throats of feebler, timider folk.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>You flew for the western eagle -- and fell</l>
<l>Doing great things for your country's pride:</l>
<l>For the beauty and peace of life you died.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Britain and France have shrined in their souls</l>
<l>Your memory; yes, and for ever you share</l>
<l>Their love with their perished lords of the air.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Invisible now, in that empty seat,</l>
<l>You sit, who came through the clouds to me,</l>
<l>Swift as a message from over the sea.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My house is always open to you:</l>
<l>Dear spirit, come often and you will find</l>
<l>Welcome, where mind can foregather with mind!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And may we sit together one day</l>
<l>Quietly here, when a word is said</l>
<l>To bring new gladness unto our dead,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Knowing your dream is a dream no more;</l>
<l>And seeing on some momentous pact</l>
<l>Your vision upbuilt as a deathless fact.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Grant that I answer this my call, yea, though the end may be</l>
<l>The naked shame, the biting flame, the last, long agony;</l>
<l>I would go singing down that road where fagots wait for me.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">You</hi> have become a forge of snow-white fire,</l>
<l>A crucible of molten steel, O France!</l>
<l>Your sons are stars who cluster to a dawn</l>
<l>And fade in light for you, O glorious France!</l>
<l>They pass through meteor changes with a song</l>
<l>Which to all islands and all continents</l>
<l>Says life is neither comfort, wealth, nor fame,</l>
<l>Nor quiet hearthstones, friendship, wife nor child,</l>
<l>Nor love, nor youth's delight, nor manhood's power,</l>
<l>Nor many days spent in a chosen work,</l>
<l>Nor honored merit, nor the patterned theme</l>
<l>Of daily labor, nor the crowns nor wreaths</l>
<l>Of seventy years.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent20">These are not all of life,</l>
<l>O France, whose sons amid the rolling thunder</l>
<l>Of cannon stand in trenches where the dead</l>
<l>Clog the ensanguined ice. But life to these</l>
<l>Prophetic and enraptured souls is vision,</l>
<l>And the keen ecstasy of fated strife,</l>
<l>And divination of the loss as gain,</l>
<l>And reading mysteries with brightened eyes</l>
<l>In fiery shock and dazzling pain before</l>
<l>The orient splendour of the face of Death,</l>
<l>As a great light beside a shadowy sea;</l>
<l>And in a high will's strenuous exercise,</l>
<l>Where the warmed spirit finds its fullest strength</l>
<l>And is no more afraid, and in the stroke</l>
<l>Of azure lightning when the hidden essence</l>
<l>And shifting meaning of man's spiritual worth</l>
<l>And mystical significance in time</l>
<pb n="36"/>
<l>Are instantly distilled to one clear drop</l>
<l>Which mirrors earth and heaven.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent20">This is life</l>
<l>Flaming to heaven in a minute's span</l>
<l>When the breath of battle blows the smouldering spark.</l>
<l>And across these seas</l>
<l>We who cry Peace and treasure life and cling</l>
<l>To cities, happiness, or daily toil</l>
<l>For daily bread, or trail the long routine</l>
<l>Of seventy years, taste not the terrible wine</l>
<l>Whereof you drink, who drain and toss the cup</l>
<l>Empty and ringing by the finished feast;</l>
<l>Or have it shaken from your hand by sight</l>
<l>Of God against the olive woods.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As Joan of Arc amid the apple trees</l>
<l>With sacred joy first heard the voices, then</l>
<l>Obeying plunged at Orleans in a field</l>
<l>Of spears and lived her dream and died in fire,</l>
<l>Thou, France, hast heard the voices and hast lived</l>
<l>The dream and known the meaning of the dream,</l>
<l>And read its riddle: how the soul of man</l>
<l>May to one greatest purpose make itself</l>
<l>A lens of clearness, how it loves the cup</l>
<l>Of deepest truth, and how its bitterest gall</l>
<l>Turns sweet to soul's surrender.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent20">And you say:</l>
<l>Take days for repetition, stretch your hands</l>
<l>For mocked renewal of familiar things:</l>
<l>The beaten path, the chair beside the window,</l>
<pb n="37"/>
<l>The crowded street, the task, the accustomed sleep,</l>
<l>And waking to the task, or many springs</l>
<l>Of lifted cloud, blue water, flowering fields --</l>
<l>The prison-house grows close no less, the feast</l>
<l>A place of memory sick for senses dulled</l>
<l>Down to the dusty end where pitiful Time</l>
<l>Grown weary cries Enough!</l></lg>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Near</hi> where the royal victims fell</l>
<l>In days gone by, caught in the swell</l>
<l>Of a ruthless tide</l>
<l>Of human passion, deep and wide:</l>
<l>There where we two</l>
<l>A Nation's later sorrow knew --</l>
<l>To-day, O friend! I stood</l>
<l>Amid a self-ruled multitude</l>
<l>That by nor sound nor word</l>
<l>Betrayed how mightily its heart was stirred.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A memory Time never could efface --</l>
<l>A memory of Grief --</l>
<l>Like a great Silence brooded o'er the place;</l>
<l>And men breathed hard, as seeking for relief</l>
<l>From an emotion strong</l>
<l>That would not cry, though held in check too long.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>One felt that joy drew near --</l>
<l>A joy intense that seemed itself to fear --</l>
<l>Brightening in eyes that had been dull,</l>
<l>As all with feeling gazed</l>
<pb n="39"/>
<l>Upon the Strasburg figure, raised</l>
<l>Above us -- mourning, beautiful!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then one stood at the statue's base, and spoke --</l>
<l>Men needed not to ask what word;</l>
<l>Each in his breast the message heard,</l>
<l>Writ for him by Despair,</l>
<l>That evermore in moving phrase</l>
<l>Breathes from the Invalides and P&#x00E8;re Lachaise --</l>
<l>Vainly it seemed, alas!</l>
<l>But now, France looking on the image there,</l>
<l>Hope gave her back the lost Alsace.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A deeper hush fell on the crowd:</l>
<l>A sound -- the lightest -- seemed too loud</l>
<l>(Would, friend, you had been there!)</l>
<l>As to that form the speaker rose,</l>
<l>Took from her, fold on fold,</l>
<l>The mournful crape, gray-worn and old,</l>
<l>Her, proudly, to disclose,</l>
<l>And with the touch of tender care</l>
<l>That fond emotion speaks,</l>
<l>'Mid tears that none could quite command,</l>
<l>Placed the Tricolor in her hand,</l>
<l>And kissed her on both cheeks!</l></lg>

<head rend="center">LANGEMARCK AT YPRES</head>

<lg type="stanza"> 
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">This</hi> is the ballad of Langemarck,</l>
<l rend="indent">A story of glory and might;</l>
<l>Of the vast Hun horde, and Canada's part</l>
<l rend="indent">In the great grim fight.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It was April fair on the Flanders Fields,</l>
<l rend="indent">But the dreadest April then</l>
<l>That ever the years, in their fateful flight,</l>
<l rend="indent">Had brought to this world of men.</l></lg>

<pb n="70"/>
<lg>
<l>North and east, a monster wall,</l>
<l rend="indent">The mighty Hun ranks lay,</l>
<l>With fort on fort, and iron-ringed trench,</l>
<l rend="indent">Menacing, grim and gray.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And south and west, like a serpent of fire,</l>
<l rend="indent">Serried the British lines,</l>
<l>And in between, the dying and dead,</l>
<l>And the stench of blood, and the trampled mud,</l>
<l rend="indent">On the fair, sweet Belgian vines.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And far to the eastward, harnessed and taut,</l>
<l rend="indent">Like a scimitar, shining and keen,</l>
<l>Gleaming out of that ominous gloom,</l>
<l rend="indent">Old France's hosts were seen.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When out of the grim Hun lines one night,</l>
<l rend="indent">There rolled a sinister smoke; --</l>
<l>A strange, weird cloud, like a pale, green shroud,</l>
<l rend="indent">And death lurked in its cloak.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>On a fiend-like wind it curled along</l>
<l rend="indent">Over the brave French ranks,</l>
<l>Like a monster tree its vapours spread,</l>
<l rend="indent">In hideous, burning banks</l>
<l>Of poisonous fumes that scorched the night</l>
<l rend="indent">With their sulphurous demon danks.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And men went mad with horror, and fled</l>
<l rend="indent">From that terrible, strangling death,</l>
<l>That seemed to sear both body and soul</l>
<l rend="indent">With its baleful, flaming breath.</l></lg>

<pb n="71"/>
<lg>
<l>Till even the little dark men of the south,</l>
<l rend="indent">Who feared neither God nor man,</l>
<l>Those fierce, wild fighters of Afric's steppes,</l>
<l rend="indent">Broke their battalions and ran: --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Ran as they never had run before,</l>
<l rend="indent">Gasping, and fainting for breath;</l>
<l>For they knew 't was no human foe that slew;</l>
<l rend="indent">And that hideous smoke meant death.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then red in the reek of that evil cloud,</l>
<l rend="indent">The Hun swept over the plain;</l>
<l>And the murderer's dirk did its monster work,</l>
<l rend="indent">'Mid the scythe-like shrapnel rain;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Till it seemed that at last the brute Hun hordes</l>
<l rend="indent">Had broken that wall of steel;</l>
<l>And that soon, through this breach in the freeman's dyke,</l>
<l rend="indent">His trampling hosts would wheel; --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And sweep to the south in ravaging might,</l>
<l rend="indent">And Europe's peoples again</l>
<l>Be trodden under the tyrant's heel,</l>
<l rend="indent">Like herds, in the Prussian pen.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But in that line on the British right,</l>
<l rend="indent">There massed a corps amain,</l>
<l>Of men who hailed from a far west land</l>
<l rend="indent">Of mountain and forest and plain;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Men new to war and its dreadest deeds,</l>
<l rend="indent">But noble and staunch and true;</l>
<l>Men of the open, East and West,</l>
<l rend="indent">Brew of old Britain's brew.</l></lg>

<pb n="72"/>
<lg>
<l>These were the men out there that night,</l>
<l rend="indent">When Hell loomed close ahead;</l>
<l>Who saw that pitiful, hideous rout,</l>
<l rend="indent">And breathed those gases dread;</l>
<l>While some went under and some went mad;</l>
<l rend="indent">But never a man there fled.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For the word was "Canada," theirs to fight,</l>
<l rend="indent">And keep on fighting still; --</l>
<l>Britain said, fight, and fight they would,</l>
<l>Though the Devil himself in sulphurous mood</l>
<l rend="indent">Came over that hideous hill.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yea, stubborn, they stood, that hero band,</l>
<l rend="indent">Where no soul hoped to live;</l>
<l>For five, 'gainst eighty thousand men,</l>
<l rend="indent">Were hopeless odds to give.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yea, fought they on! 'T was Friday eve,</l>
<l rend="indent">When that demon gas drove down;</l>
<l>'T was Saturday eve that saw them still</l>
<l rend="indent">Grimly holding their own;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Sunday, Monday, saw them yet,</l>
<l rend="indent">A steadily lessening band,</l>
<l>With "no surrender" in their hearts,</l>
<l rend="indent">But the dream of a far-off land,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Where mother and sister and love would weep</l>
<l rend="indent">For the hushed heart lying still; --</l>
<l>But never a thought but to do their part,</l>
<l rend="indent">And work the Empire's will.</l></lg>

<pb n="73"/>
<lg>
<l>Ringed round, hemmed in, and back to back,</l>
<l rend="indent">They fought there under the dark,</l>
<l>And won for Empire, God and Right,</l>
<l rend="indent">At grim, red Langemarck.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Wonderful battles have shaken this world,</l>
<l rend="indent">Since the Dawn-God overthrew Dis;</l>
<l>Wonderful struggles of right against wrong,</l>
<l>Sung in the rhymes of the world's great song,</l>
<l rend="indent">But never a greater than this.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Bannockburn, Inkerman, Balaclava,</l>
<l rend="indent">Marathon's godlike stand;</l>
<l>But never a more heroic deed,</l>
<l>And never a greater warrior breed,</l>
<l rend="indent">In any war-man's land.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>This is the ballad of Langemarck,</l>
<l rend="indent">A story of glory and might;</l>
<l>Of the vast Hun horde, and Canada's part</l>
<l rend="indent">In the great, grim fight.</l></lg>

<l>But the Night was torn with gashes --</l>
<l>Sudden ragged crimson gashes --</l>
<l>And the siege-guns snarled and roared,</l>
<l>With their flames thrust like a sword,</l>
<l>And the tranquil moon came riding on the heaven's silver ford.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What a fearful world was there,</l>
<l>Tangled in the cold moon's hair!</l>
<l>Man and beast lay hurt and screaming,</l>
<l>(Men must die when Kings are dreaming!) --</l>
<l>While within the harried town</l>
<l>Mothers dragged their children down</l>
<l>As the awful rain came screaming,</l>
<l>For the glory of a Crown!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So the Morning flung her cloak</l>
<l>Through the hanging pall of smoke</l>
<l>Trimmed with red, it was, and dripping with a deep and angry stain!</l>
<l>And the Day came walking then</l>
<l>Through a lane of murdered men,</l>
<l>And her light fell down before her like a Cross upon the plain!</l>
<l>But the forts still crowned the height</l>
<l>With a bitter iron crown!</l>
<l>They had lived to flame and fight,</l>
<l>They had lived to keep the Town!</l>
<l>And they poured their havoc down</l>
<l>All that day... and all that night....</l>
<pb n="80"/>
<l>While four times their number came,</l>
<l>Pawns that played a bloody game! --</l>
<l>With a silver trumpeting,</l>
<l>For the glory of the King,</l>
<l>To the barriers of the thunder and the fury of the flame!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So they stormed the iron Hill,</l>
<l>O'er the sleepers lying still,</l>
<l>And their trumpets sang them forward through the dull succeeding dawns,</l>
<l>But the thunder flung them wide,</l>
<l>And they crumpled up and died, --</l>
<l>They had waged the war of monarchs -- and they died the death of pawns.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But the forts still stood.... Their breath</l>
<l>Swept the foeman like a blade,</l>
<l>Though ten thousand men were paid</l>
<l>To the hungry purse of Death,</l>
<l>Though the field was wet with blood,</l>
<l>Still the bold defences stood,</l>
<l>Stood!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And the King came out with his bodyguard at the day's departing gleam --</l>
<l>And the moon rode up behind the smoke and showed the King his dream.</l></lg>

<l>Frogs somewhere near the roadside</l>

<l>Beyond the hills it shines now</l>

<l>On reek of trenches thunder-shocked,</l>
<l>Tense fury of wills in wrestle locked,</l>
<l rend="indent">A chaos crumbled red!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The five men in the moonlight</l>
<l rend="indent">Chat, joke, or gaze apart.</l>
<l>They talk of days and comrades,</l>
<l rend="indent">But each one hides his heart.</l></lg>

<lg>

<l rend="indent">Gesture and shape distort,</l>

<l rend="indent">That dogs them for his sport:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But as if dead men were risen</l>
<l rend="indent">And stood before me there</l>
<l>With a terrible fame about them blown</l>
<l rend="indent">In beams of spectral air,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I see them, men transfigured</l>
<l rend="indent">As in a dream, dilate</l>
<l>Fabulous with the Titan-throb</l>
<l rend="indent">Of battling Europe's fate;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For history 's hushed before them,</l>
<l rend="indent">And legend flames afresh, --</l>

<l rend="indent">Is written on their flesh.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Throstle and blackbird stiff with cold</l>
<l>Hop on the frozen grass;</l>

<l>The dun deer slowly pass.</l></lg>

<l>The Parliament that broke the Right Divine</l>
<l rend="indent">Shall see her realm of reason swept away,</l>
<l rend="indent">And lesser nations shall the sword obey --</l>

<l>So on the English Channel boasts the foe</l>
<l rend="indent">On whose imperial brow death's helmet nods.</l>
<l>Look where his hosts o'er bloody Belgium go,</l>
<l rend="indent">And mix a nation's past with blazing sods!</l>
<l>A kingdom's waste! a people's homeless woe!</l>

<l>Far fall the day when England's realm shall see</l>
<l rend="indent">The sunset of dominion! Her increase</l>
<l rend="indent">Abolishes the man-dividing seas,</l>
<l>And frames the brotherhood on earth to be!</l>
<l>She, in free peoples planting sovereignty,</l>
<l rend="indent">Orbs half the civil world in British peace;</l>
<l rend="indent">And though time dispossess her, and she cease,</l>

<l>Hearken, the feet of the Destroyer tread</l>

<l rend="indent">England, the mother-acne of our brood,</l>

<l rend="indent">So in the night the Belgian cities flare</l>

<l rend="indent">Though not to me the golden morn appears,</l>

<l>For man doth build on an eternal scale,</l>

[Concerning the experiences of a journey on foot through the night of
August 4, 1914 (the night alter the formal declaration of war between
England and Germany), from a town near Amiens, in France, to Dieppe, a distance of somewhat more than forty miles.]
</note>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Before</hi> I knew, the Dawn was on the road,</l>
<l>Close at my side, so silently he came</l>
<l>Nor gave a sign of salutation, save</l>
<l>To touch with light my sleeve and make the way</l>
<l>Appear as if a shining countenance</l>
<l>Had looked on it. Strange was this radiant Youth,</l>
<l>As I, to these fair, fertile parts of France,</l>
<l>Where C&#x00E6;sar with his legions once had passed,</l>
<l>And where the Kaiser's Uhlans yet would pass</l>
<l>Or e'er another moon should cope with clouds</l>
<l>For mastery of these same fields. -- To-night</l>
<l>(And but a month has gone since I walked there)</l>
<pb n="113"/>
<l>Well might the Kaiser write, as C&#x00E6;sar wrote,</l>
<l>In his new Commentaries on a Gallic war,</l>
<l>"<hi rend="italic">Fortissimi Belg&#x00E6;</hi>." -- A moon ago!</l>
<l>Who would have then divined that dead would lie</l>
<l>Like swaths of grain beneath the harvest moon</l>
<l>Upon these lands the ancient Belg&#x00E6; held,</l>
<l>From Normandy beyond renowned Li&#x00E8;ge! --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But it was out of that dread August night</l>
<l>From which all Europe woke to war, that we,</l>
<l>This beautiful Dawn-Youth, and I, had come,</l>
<l>He from afar. Beyond grim Petrograd</l>
<l>He'd waked the moujik from his peaceful dreams,</l>
<l>Bid the muezzin call to morning prayer</l>
<l>Where minarets rise o'er the Golden Horn,</l>
<l>And driven shadows from the Prussian march</l>
<l>To lie beneath the lindens of the <hi rend="italic">stadt</hi>.</l>
<l>Softly he'd stirred the bells to ring at Rheims,</l>
<l>He'd knocked at high Montmartre, hardly asleep,</l>
<l>Heard the sweet carillon of doomed Louvain,</l>
<l>Boylike, had tarried for a moment's play</l>
<l>Amid the traceries of Amiens,</l>
<l>And then was hast'ning on the road to Dieppe,</l>
<l>When he o'ertook me drowsy from the hours</l>
<l>Through which I'd walked, with no companions else</l>
<l>Than ghostly kilometer posts that stood</l>
<l>As sentinels of space along the way. --</l>
<l>Often, in doubt, I'd paused to question one,</l>
<l>With nervous hands, as they who read Moon-type;</l>
<l>And more than once I'd caught a moment's sleep</l>
<l>Beside the highway, in the dripping grass,</l>
<l>While one of these white sentinels stood guard,</l>
<l>Knowing me for a friend, who loves the road,</l>
<pb n="114"/>
<l>And best of all by night, when wheels do sleep</l>
<l>And stars alone do walk abroad. -- But once</l>
<l>Three watchful shadows, deeper than the dark,</l>
<l>Laid hands on me and searched me for the marks</l>
<l>Of traitor or of spy, only to find</l>
<l>Over my heart the badge of loyalty. --</l>
<l>With wish for <hi rend="italic">bon voyage</hi> they gave me o'er</l>
<l>To the white guards who led me on again.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Thus Dawn o'ertook me and with magic speech</l>
<l>Made me forget the night as we strode on.</l>
<l>Where'er he looked a miracle was wrought:</l>
<l>A tree grew from the darkness at a glance;</l>
<l>A hut was thatched; a new ch&#x00E2;teau was reared</l>
<l>Of stone, as weathered as the church at C&#x00E6;n;</l>
<l>Gray blooms were coloured suddenly in red;</l>
<l>A flag was flung across the eastern sky. --</l>
<l>Nearer at hand, he made me then aware</l>
<l>Of peasant women bending in the fields,</l>
<l>Cradling and gleaning by the first scant light,</l>
<l>Their sons and husbands somewhere o'er the edge</l>
<l>Of these green-golden fields which they had sowed,</l>
<l>But will not reap, -- out somewhere on the march,</l>
<l>God but knows where and if they come again.</l>
<l>One fallow field he pointed out to me</l>
<l>Where but the day before a peasant ploughed,</l>
<l>Dreaming of next year's fruit, and there his plough</l>
<l>Stood now mid-field, his horses commandeered,</l>
<l>A monstrous sable crow perched on the beam.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Before I knew, the Dawn was on the road,</l>
<l>Far from my side, so silently he went,</l>
<l>Catching his golden helmet as he ran,</l>
<pb n="115"/>
<l>And hast'ning on along the dun straight way,</l>
<l>Where old men's sabots now began to clack</l>
<l>And withered women, knitting, led their cows,</l>
<l>On, on to call the men of Kitchener</l>
<l>Down to their coasts, -- I shouting after him:</l>
<l>"O Dawn, would you had let the world sleep on</l>
<l>Till all its armament were turned to rust,</l>
<l>Nor waked it to this day of hideous hate,</l>
<l>Of man's red murder and of woman's woe!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Famished and lame, I came at last to Dieppe,</l>
<l>But Dawn had made his way across the sea,</l>
<l>And, as I climbed with heavy feet the cliff,</l>
<l>Was even then upon the sky-built towers</l>
<l>Of that great capital where nations all,</l>
<l>Teuton, Italian, Gallic, English, Slav,</l>
<l>Forget long hates in one consummate faith.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The tides of war had ebb'd away</l>
<l>From Trachis and Thermopyl&#x00E6;,</l>
<l>Long centuries had come and gone</l>
<l>Since that fierce day at Marathon;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Freedom was firmly based, and we</l>
<l>Wall'd by our own encircling sea;</l>
<l>The ancient passions dead, and men</l>
<l>Battl'd with ledger and with pen.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So seem'd it, but to them alone</l>
<l>The wisdom of the gods is known;</l>
<l>Lest freedom's price decline, from far</l>
<l>Zeus hurl'd the thunderbolt of war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And so once more the Persian steel</l>
<l>The armies of the Greeks must feel,</l>
<l>And once again a Xerxes know</l>
<l>The virtue of a Spartan foe.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Thus may the cloudy fates unroll'd</l>
<l>Retrace the starry circles old,</l>
<l>And the recurrent heavens decree</l>
<l>A Periclean dynasty.</l></lg>

<l>We have been very anxious lest matters had not gone well</l>
<l>With you and the precious cargo of your country's drugs and dyes.</l>
<l>But here you are at last, and the sight is good for our eyes,</l>
<l>Glad to welcome you up and out of the caves of the sea.</l>

<l>Oh, do not be impatient, good friends of this neutral land,</l>
<l>That we have been so tardy in reaching your eager strand.</l>
<l>We were stopped by a curious chance just off the Irish coast,</l>
<pb n="137"/>
<l>Where the mightiest wreck ever was lay crowded with a host</l>
<l>Of the dead that went down with her; and some prayed us to bring them here</l>
<l>That they might be at home with their brothers and sisters dear.</l>
<l>We Germans have tender hearts, and it grieved us sore to say</l>
<l>We were not a passenger ship, and to most we must answer nay,</l>
<l>But if from among their hundreds they could somehow a half-score choose</l>
<l>We thought we could manage to bring them, and we would not refuse.</l>
<l>They chose, and the women and children that are greeting you here are those</l>
<l>Ghosts of the women and children that the rest of the hundred chose.</l></lg>

<l>What guff are you giving us, Captain! We are able to tell, we hope,</l>

<l>Come, come, get down to business! For time is money, you know,</l>
<l>And you must make up in both to us for having been so slow.</l>
<l>Better tell this story of yours to the submarines, for we</l>
<l>Know there was no such wreck, and none of your spookery.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">She</hi> was binding the wounds of her enemies when they came --</l>
<l rend="indent">The lint in her hand unrolled.</l>
<l>They battered the door with their rifle-butts, crashed it in:</l>
<l rend="indent">She faced them gentle and bold.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They haled her before the judges where they sat</l>
<l rend="indent">In their places, helmet on head.</l>
<l>With question and menace the judges assailed her, "Yes,</l>
<l rend="indent">I have broken your law," she said.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"I have tended the hurt and hidden the hunted, have done</l>
<l rend="indent">As a sister does to a brother,</l>
<l>Because of a law that is greater than you have made,</l>
<l rend="indent">Because I could do none other.</l></lg>

<pb n="139"/>
<lg>
<l>"Deal as you will with me. This is my choice to the end,</l>
<l rend="indent">To live in the life I vowed."</l>
<l>"She is self-confessed," they cried; "she is self-condemned.</l>
<l rend="indent">She shall die, that the rest may be cowed."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In the terrible hour of the dawn, when the veins are cold,</l>
<l rend="indent">They led her forth to the wall.</l>
<l>"I have loved my land," she said, "but it is not enough:</l>
<l rend="indent">Love requires of me all.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"I will empty my heart of bitterness, hating none."</l>
<l rend="indent">And sweetness filled her brave</l>
<l>With a vision of understanding beyond the hour</l>
<l rend="indent">That knelled to the waiting grave.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They bound her eyes, but she stood as if she shone.</l>
<l rend="indent">The rifles it was that shook</l>
<l>When the hoarse command rang out. They could not endure</l>
<l rend="indent">That last, that defenceless look.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And the officer strode and pistolled her surely, ashamed</l>
<l rend="indent">That men, seasoned in blood,</l>
<l>Should quail at a woman, only a woman, --</l>
<l rend="indent">As a flower stamped in the mud.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now that the deed was securely done, in the night</l>
<l rend="indent">When none had known her fate,</l>
<pb n="140"/>
<l>They answered those that had striven for her, day by day:</l>
<l rend="indent">"It is over, you come too late."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And with many words and sorrowful-phrased excuse</l>
<l rend="indent">Argued their German right</l>
<l>To kill, most legally; hard though the duty be,</l>
<l rend="indent">The law must assert its might.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Only a woman! yet she had pity on them,</l>
<l rend="indent">The victim offered slain</l>
<l>To the gods of fear that they worship. Leave them there,</l>
<l rend="indent">Red hands, to clutch their gain!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>She bewailed not herself, and we will bewail her not,</l>
<l rend="indent">But with tears of pride rejoice</l>
<l>That an English soul was found so crystal-clear</l>
<l rend="indent">To be the triumphant voice</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Of the human heart that dares adventure all</l>
<l rend="indent">But live to itself untrue,</l>
<l>And beyond all laws sees love as the light in the night,</l>
<l rend="indent">As the star it must answer to.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The hurts she healed, the thousands comforted -- these</l>
<l rend="indent">Make a fragrance of her fame.</l>
<l>But because she stept to her star right on through death</l>
<l rend="indent">It is Victory speaks her name.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">THE HELL-GATE OF SOISSONS</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">My</hi> name is Darino, the poet. You
have heard? <hi rend="italic">Oui, Com&#x00E9;die Fran&#x00E7;aise</hi>.</l>
<l>Perchance it has happened, <hi rend="italic">mon ami</hi>, you know of my unworthy lays.</l>
<l>Ah, then you must guess how my fingers are itching to talk to a pen;</l>
<l>For I was at Soissons, and saw it, the death of twelve Englishmen.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My leg, <hi rend="italic">malheureusement</hi>, I left it behind on the banks of the Aisne.</l>
<l>Regret? I would pay with the other to witness their valor again.</l>
<l>A trifle, indeed, I assure you, to give for the honor to tell</l>
<l>How that handful of British, undaunted, went into the Gateway of Hell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Let me draw you a plan of the battle. Here we French and your Engineers stood;</l>
<l>Over there a detachment of German sharpshooters lay hid in a wood.</l>
<l>A <hi rend="italic">mitrailleuse</hi> battery planted on top of this well-chosen ridge</l>
<l>Held the road for the Prussians and covered the direct approach to the bridge.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It was madness to dare the dense murder that spewed from those ghastly machines.</l>
<l>(Only those who have danced to its music can know what the <hi rend="italic">mitrailleuse</hi> means.)</l>
<pb n="142"/>
<l>But the bridge on the Aisne was a menace; our safety demanded its fall:</l>
<l>"Engineers, -- volunteers!" In a body, the Royals stood out at the call.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Death at best was the fate of that mission -- to their glory not one was dismayed.</l>
<l>A party was chosen -- and seven survived till the powder was laid.</l>
<l>And <hi rend="italic">they</hi> died with their fuses unlighted. Another detachment! Again</l>
<l>A sortie is made -- all too vainly. The bridge still commanded the Aisne.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We were fighting two foes -- Time and Prussia -- the moments were worth more than troops.</l>
<l>We <hi rend="italic">must</hi> blow up the bridge. A lone soldier darts out from the Royals and swoops</l>
<l>For the fuse! Fate seems with us. We cheer him; he answers -- our hopes are reborn!</l>
<l>A ball rips his visor -- his khaki shows red where another has torn.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Will he live -- will he last -- will he make it? <hi rend="italic">H&#x00E9;las!</hi> And so near to the goal!</l>
<l>A second, he dies! then a third one! A fourth! Still the Germans take toll!</l>
<l>A fifth, <hi rend="italic">magnifique!</hi> It is magic! How does he escape them? He may...</l>
<l>Yes, he <hi rend="italic">does!</hi> See, the match flares! A rifle rings out from the woods and says "Nay!"</l></lg>

<pb n="143"/>
<lg>
<l>Six, seven, eight, nine take their places, six, seven, eight, nine brave their hail;</l>
<l>Six, seven, eight, nine -- how we count them! But the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth fail!</l>
<l>A tenth! <hi rend="italic">Sacr&#x00E9; nom!</hi> But these English are soldiers -- they know how to try;</l>
<l>(He fumbles the place where his jaw was) -- they show, too, how heroes can die.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Ten we count -- ten who ventured unquailing -- ten there were -- and ten no more!</l>
<l>Yet another salutes and superbly essays where the ten failed before.</l>
<l>God of Battles, look down and protect him! Lord, his heart is as Thine -- let him live!</l>
<l>But the <hi rend="italic">mitrailleuse</hi> splutters and stutters, and riddles him into a sieve.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then I thought of my sins, and sat waiting the charge that we could not withstand,</l>
<l>And I thought of my beautiful Paris, and gave a last look at the land,</l>
<l>At France, my <hi rend="italic">belle France</hi>, in her glory of blue sky and green field and wood.</l>
<l>Death with honor, but never surrender. And to die with such men -- it was good.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They are forming, the bugles are blaring -- they will cross in a moment and then...</l>
<l>When out of the line of the Royals (your island, <hi rend="italic">mon ami</hi>, breeds men)</l>
<pb n="144"/>
<l>Burst a private, a tawny-haired giant -- it was hopeless, but <hi rend="italic">ciel!</hi> how he ran!</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Bon Dieu</hi> please remember the pattern, and make many more on his plan!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>No cheers from our ranks, and the Germans, they halted in wonderment too;</l>
<l>See, he reaches the bridge; ah! he lights it! I am dreaming, it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be true.</l>
<l>Screams of rage! <hi rend="italic">Fusillade!</hi> They have killed him! Too late, though, the good work is done.</l>
<l>By the valor of twelve English martyrs, the Hell-Gate of Soissons is won!</l></lg>

<head rend="center">A LETTER FROM THE FRONT</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcap">was</hi> out early to-day, spying about</l>
<l>From the top of a haystack -- such a lovely morning --</l>
<l>And when I mounted again to canter back</l>
<l>I saw across a field in the broad sunlight</l>
<l>A young Gunner Subaltern, stalking along</l>
<l>With a rook-rifle held at the ready, and -- would you believe it? --</l>
<l>A domestic cat, soberly marching beside him.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So I laughed, and felt quite well disposed to the youngster,</l>
<l>And shouted out "the top of the morning" to him,</l>
<pb n="146"/>
<l>And wished him "Good sport!" -- and then I remembered</l>
<l>My rank, and his, and what I ought to be doing:</l>
<l>And I rode nearer, and added, "I can only suppose</l>
<l>You have not seen the Commander-in-Chief's order</l>
<l>Forbidding English officers to annoy their Allies</l>
<l>By hunting and shooting."</l>
<l rend="indent9">But he stood and saluted</l>
<l>And said earnestly, "I beg your pardon, Sir,</l>
<l>I was only going out to shoot a sparrow</l>
<l>To feed my cat with."</l>
<l rend="indent9">So there was the whole picture,</l>
<l>The lovely early morning, the occasional shell</l>
<l>Screeching and scattering past us, the empty landscape, --</l>
<l>Empty, except for the young Gunner saluting,</l>
<l>And the cat, anxiously watching his every movement.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I may be wrong, and I may have told it badly,</l>
<l>But it struck <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as being extremely ludicrous.</l></lg>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> naked earth is warm with Spring,</l>
<l rend="indent">And with green grass and bursting trees</l>
<l>Leans to the sun's gaze glorying,</l>
<l rend="indent">And quivers in the sunny breeze;</l>
<l>And Life is Colour and Warmth and Light,</l>
<l rend="indent">And a striving evermore for these;</l>
<l>And he is dead who will not fight;</l>
<l rend="indent">And who dies fighting has increase.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The fighting man shall from the sun</l>
<l rend="indent">Take warmth, and life from the glowing earth;</l>
<l>Speed with the light-foot winds to run,</l>
<l rend="indent">And with the trees to newer birth;</l>
<l>And find, when fighting shall be done,</l>
<l rend="indent">Great rest, and fullness after dearth.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>All the bright company of Heaven</l>
<l rend="indent">Hold him in their high comradeship,</l>
<l>The Dog-Star, and the Sisters Seven,</l>
<l rend="indent">Orion's Belt and sworded hip.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The woodland trees that stand together,</l>
<l rend="indent">They stand to him each one a friend;</l>
<l>They gently speak in the windy weather;</l>
<l rend="indent">They guide to valley and ridges' end.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The kestrel hovering by day,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the little owls that call by night,</l>
<l>Bid him be swift and keen as they,</l>
<l rend="indent">As keen of ear, as swift of sight.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="155"/>
<l>The blackbird sings to him, "Brother, brother,</l>
<l rend="indent">If this be the last song you shall sing,</l>
<l>Sing well, for you may not sing another;</l>
<l rend="indent">Brother, sing."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In dreary, doubtful, waiting hours,</l>
<l rend="indent">Before the brazen frenzy starts,</l>
<l>The horses show him nobler powers;</l>
<l rend="indent">O patient eyes, courageous hearts!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And when the burning moment breaks,</l>
<l rend="indent">And all things else are out of mind,</l>
<l>And only Joy-Of-Battle takes</l>
<l rend="indent">Him by the throat, and makes him blind,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Through joy and blindness he shall know,</l>
<l rend="indent">Not caring much to know, that still</l>
<l>Nor lead nor steel shall reach him, so</l>
<l rend="indent">That it be not the Destined Will.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The thundering line of battle stands,</l>
<l rend="indent">And in the air Death moans and sings:</l>
<l>But Day shall clasp him with strong hands,</l>
<l rend="indent">And Night shall fold him in soft wings.</l></lg>

<l>Of those weird battles in the West</l>
<l>Wherein he put old skill to use,</l>

<l>At early dawn in the pale gray light.</l>
<l>Never a house and never a hedge</l>
<l>In No Man's Land from edge to edge,</l>
<pb n="159"/>
<l>And never a living soul walks there</l>
<l>To taste the fresh of the morning air; --</l>
<l>Only some lumps of rotting clay,</l>
<l>That were friends or foemen yesterday.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What are the bounds of No Man's Land?</l>
<l>You can see them clearly on either hand,</l>
<l>A mound of rag-bags gray in the sun,</l>
<l>Or a furrow of brown where the earthworks run</l>
<l>From the eastern hills to the western sea,</l>
<l>Through field or forest o'er river and lea;</l>
<l>No man may pass them, but aim you well</l>
<l>And Death rides across on the bullet or shell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But No Man's Land is a goblin sight</l>
<l>When patrols crawl over at dead o' night;</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Boche</hi> or British, Belgian or French,</l>
<l>You dice with death when you cross the trench.</l>
<l>When the "rapid," like fireflies in the dark,</l>
<l>Flits down the parapet spark by spark,</l>
<l>And you drop for cover to keep your head</l>
<l>With your face on the breast of the four months' dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The man who ranges in No Man's Land</l>
<l>Is dogged by the shadows on either hand</l>
<l>When the star-shell's flare, as it bursts o'erhead,</l>
<l>Scares the gray rats that feed on the dead,</l>
<l>And the bursting bomb or the bayonet-snatch</l>
<l>May answer the click of your safety-catch,</l>
<l>For the lone patrol, with his life in his hand,</l>
<l>Is hunting for blood in No Man's Land.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">CHAMPAGNE, 1914-15</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">In</hi> the glad revels, in the happy f&#x00EA;tes,</l>
<l rend="indent">When cheeks are flushed, and glasses gilt and pearled</l>
<l>With the sweet wine of France that concentrates</l>
<l rend="indent">The sunshine and the beauty of the world,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Drink sometimes, you whose footsteps yet may tread</l>
<l rend="indent">The undisturbed, delightful paths of Earth,</l>
<l>To those whose blood, in pious duty shed,</l>
<l rend="indent">Hallows the soil where that same wine had birth.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Here, by devoted comrades laid away,</l>
<l rend="indent">Along our lines they slumber where they fell,</l>
<l>Beside the crater at the Ferme d'Alger</l>
<l rend="indent">And up the bloody slopes of La Pompelle,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And round the city whose cathedral towers</l>
<l rend="indent">The enemies of Beauty dared profane,</l>
<l>And in the mat of multicolored flowers</l>
<l rend="indent">That clothe the sunny chalk-fields of Champagne.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Under the little crosses where they rise</l>
<l rend="indent">The soldier rests. Now round him undismayed</l>
<l>The cannon thunders, and at night he lies</l>
<l rend="indent">At peace beneath the eternal fusillade...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>That other generations might possess --</l>
<l rend="indent">From shame and menace free in years to come --</l>
<l>A richer heritage of happiness,</l>
<l rend="indent">He marched to that heroic martyrdom.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Esteeming less the forfeit that he paid</l>
<l rend="indent">Than undishonored that his flag might float</l>
<pb n="161"/>
<l>Over the towers of liberty, he made</l>
<l rend="indent">His breast the bulwark and his blood the moat.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Obscurely sacrificed, his nameless tomb,</l>
<l rend="indent">Bare of the sculptor's art, the poet's lines,</l>
<l>Summer shall flush with poppy-fields in bloom,</l>
<l rend="indent">And Autumn yellow with maturing vines.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There the grape-pickers at their harvesting</l>
<l rend="indent">Shall lightly tread and load their wicker trays,</l>
<l>Blessing his memory as they toil and sing</l>
<l rend="indent">In the slant sunshine of October days...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I love to think that if my blood should be</l>
<l rend="indent">So privileged to sink where his has sunk,</l>
<l>I shall not pass from Earth entirely,</l>
<l rend="indent">But when the banquet rings, when healths are drunk,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And faces that the joys of living fill</l>
<l rend="indent">Glow radiant with laughter and good cheer,</l>
<l>In beaming cups some spark of me shall still</l>
<l rend="indent">Brim toward the lips that once I held so dear.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So shall one coveting no higher plane</l>
<l rend="indent">Than nature clothes in color and flesh and tone,</l>
<l>Even from the grave put upward to attain</l>
<l rend="indent">The dreams youth cherished and missed and might have known;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And that strong need that strove unsatisfied</l>
<l rend="indent">Toward earthly beauty in all forms it wore,</l>
<l>Not death itself shall utterly divide</l>
<l rend="indent">From the belov&#x00E8;d shapes it thirsted for.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="162"/>
<l>Alas, how many an adept for whose arms</l>
<l rend="indent">Life held delicious offerings perished here,</l>
<l>How many in the prime of all that charms,</l>
<l rend="indent">Crowned with all gifts that conquer and endear!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Honor them not so much with tears and flowers,</l>
<l rend="indent">But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies,</l>
<l>Where in the anguish of atrocious hours</l>
<l rend="indent">Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Rather when music on bright gatherings lays</l>
<l rend="indent">Its tender spell, and joy is uppermost,</l>
<l>Be mindful of the men they were, and raise</l>
<l rend="indent">Your glasses to them in one silent toast.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Drink to them -- - amorous of dear Earth as well,</l>
<l rend="indent">They asked no tribute lovelier than this -- -</l>
<l>And in the wine that ripened where they fell,</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, frame your lips as though it were a kiss.</l></lg>

<l n="1">A <hi rend="smallcap">league</hi> and a league from the trenches -- from the traversed maze of the lines,</l>
<l>Where daylong the sniper watches and daylong the bullet whines,</l>
<l>And the cratered earth is in travail with mines and with countermines --</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="163"/>
<l>Here, where haply some woman dreamed (are those her roses that bloom</l>
<l>In the garden beyond the windows of my littered working room?)</l>
<l>We have decked the map for our masters as a bride is decked for the groom.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Fair, on each lettered numbered square -- crossroad and mound and wire,</l>
<l>Loophole, redoubt, and emplacement -- lie the targets their mouths desire;</l>
<l>Gay with purples and browns and  blues, have we traced them their arcs of fire.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And ever the type-keys chatter; and ever our keen wires bring</l>
<l>Word from the watchers a-crouch below, word from the watchers a-wing:</l>
<l>And ever we hear the distant growl of our hid guns thundering.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Hear it hardly, and turn again to our maps, where the trench lines crawl,</l>
<l>Red on the gray and each with a sign for the ranging shrapnel's fall --</l>
<l>Snakes that our masters shall scotch at down, as is written here on the wall.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For the weeks of our waiting draw to a close.... There is scarcely a leaf astir</l>
<l>In the garden beyond my windows, where the twilight shadows blur</l>
<l>The blaze of some woman's roses.... "Bombardment orders, sir."</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Green</hi> gardens in Laventie!</l>
<l>Soldiers only know the street</l>
<l>Where the mud is churned and splashed about</l>
<l rend="indent4">By battle-wending feet;</l>
<l>And yet beside one stricken house there is a glimpse of grass --</l>
<l rend="indent4">Look for it when you pass.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Beyond the church whose pitted spire</l>
<l>Seems balanced on a strand</l>
<l>Of swaying stone and tottering brick,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Two roofless ruins stand;</l>
<l>And here, among the wreckage, where the back-wall should have been,</l>
<l rend="indent4">We found a garden green.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The grass was never trodden on,</l>
<l>The little path of gravel</l>
<l>Was overgrown with celandine;</l>
<l rend="indent4">No other folk did travel</l>
<l>Along its weedy surface but the nimble-footed mouse,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Running from house to house.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So all along the tender blades</l>
<l>Of soft and vivid grass</l>
<l>We lay, nor heard the limber wheels</l>
<l rend="indent4">That pass and ever pass</l>
<l>In noisy continuity until their stony rattle</l>
<l rend="indent4">Seems in itself a battle.</l></lg>

<pb n="165"/>
<lg>
<l>At length we rose up from this ease</l>
<l>Of tranquil happy mind,</l>
<l>And searched the garden's little length</l>
<l rend="indent4">Some new pleasaunce to find;</l>
<l>And there some yellow daffodils, and jasmine hanging high,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Did rest the tired eye.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The fairest and most fragrant</l>
<l>Of the many sweets we found</l>
<l>Was a little bush of Daphne flower</l>
<l rend="indent4">Upon a mossy mound,</l>
<l>And so thick were the blossoms set and so divine the scent,</l>
<l rend="indent4">That we were well content.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Hungry for Spring I bent my head,</l>
<l>The perfume fanned my face,</l>
<l>And all my soul was dancing</l>
<l rend="indent4">In that lovely little place,</l>
<l>Dancing with a measured step from wrecked and shattered towns</l>
<l rend="indent4">Away... upon the Downs.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I saw green banks of daffodil,</l>
<l>Slim poplars in the breeze,</l>
<l>Great tan-brown hares in gusty March</l>
<l rend="indent4">A-courting on the leas.</l>
<l>And meadows, with their glittering streams -- and silver-scurrying dace --</l>
<l rend="indent4">Home, what a perfect place!</l></lg>

<l>He layeth hands of healing upon my flesh,</l>

<l>Until my soul reaches out myriad and infinite hands</l>
<l>Toward him,</l>
<l>And is eased of its hunger.</l></lg>

<l>And I know that this passes:</l>
<l>This implacable fury and torment of men,</l>

<l>And the stillness hath said unto me,</l>

<l>And these were begotten,</l>
<l>O Love, and lived lightly, and burnt</l>
<l>With the lust of a man's first strength: ere they were rent,</l>
<l>Almost at unawares, savagely; and strewn</l>
<l>In bloody fragments, to be the carrion</l>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Courage</hi> came to you with your boyhood's grace</l>
<l rend="indent4">Of ardent life and limb.</l>
<l>Each day new dangers steeled you to the test,</l>
<l rend="indent4">To ride, to climb, to swim.</l>
<l>Your hot blood taught you carelessness of death</l>
<l rend="indent9">With every breath.</l></lg>

<l rend="indent4">The end -- perhaps your grave.</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">When</hi> consciousness came back, he found he lay</l>
<l>Between the opposing fires, but could not tell</l>
<l>On which hand were his friends; and either way</l>
<l>For him to turn was chancy -- bullet and shell</l>
<l>Whistling and shrieking over him, as the glare</l>
<l>Of searchlights scoured the darkness to blind day.</l>
<l>He scrambled to his hands and knees ascare,</l>
<l>Dragging his wounded foot through puddled clay,</l>
<l>And tumbled in a hole a shell had scooped</l>
<l>At random in a turnip-field between</l>
<l>The unseen trenches where the foes lay cooped</l>
<l>Through that unending battle of unseen,</l>
<l>Dead-locked, league-stretching armies; and quite spent</l>
<l>He rolled upon his back within the pit,</l>
<l>And lay secure, thinking of all it meant --</l>
<l>His lying in that little hole, sore hit,</l>
<l>But living, while across the starry sky</l>
<l>Shrapnel and shell went screeching overhead --</l>
<l>Of all it meant that he, Tom Dodd, should lie</l>
<l>Among the Belgian turnips, while his bed...</l>
<l>If it were he, indeed, who'd climbed each night,</l>
<l>Fagged with the day's work, up the narrow stair,</l>
<l>And slipt his clothes off in the candle-light,</l>
<l>Too tired to fold them neatly in a chair</l>
<l>The way his mother'd taught him -- too dog-tired</l>
<l>After the long day's serving in the shop,</l>
<l>Inquiring what each customer required,</l>
<l>Politely talking weather, fit to drop...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now for fourteen days and nights, at least,</l>
<l>He had n't had his clothes off, and had lain</l>
<pb n="208"/>
<l>In muddy trenches, napping like a beast</l>
<l>With one eye open, under sun and rain</l>
<l>And that unceasing hell-fire...</l>
<l rend="right">It was strange</l>
<l>How things turned out -- the chances! You'd just got</l>
<l>To take your luck in life, you could n't change</l>
<l>Your luck.</l>
<l rend="right">And so here he was lying shot</l>
<l>Who just six months ago had thought to spend</l>
<l>His days behind a counter. Still, perhaps...</l>
<l>And now, God only knew how he would end!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He'd like to know haw many of the chaps</l>
<l>Had won back to the trench alive, when he</l>
<l>Had fallen wounded and been left for dead,</l>
<l>If any!...</l>
<l rend="right">This was different, certainly,</l>
<l>From selling knots of tape and reels of thread</l>
<l>And knots of tape and reels of thread and knots</l>
<l>Of tape and reels of thread and knots of tape,</l>
<l>Day in, day out, and answering "Have you got"'s</l>
<l>And "Do you keep"'s till there seemed no escape</l>
<l>From everlasting serving in a shop,</l>
<l>Inquiring what each customer required,</l>
<l>Politely talking weather, fit to drop,</l>
<l>With swollen ankles, tired...</l>
<l rend="right">But he was tired</l>
<l>Now. Every bone was aching, and had ached</l>
<l>For fourteen days and nights in that wet trench --</l>
<l>Just duller when he slept than when he waked --</l>
<l>Crouching for shelter from the steady drench</l>
<l>Of shell and shrapnel...</l>
<pb n="209"/>
<l rend="right">That old trench, it seemed</l>
<l>Almost like home to him. He'd slept and fed</l>
<l>And sung and smoked in it, while shrapnel screamed</l>
<l>And shells went whining harmless overhead --</l>
<l>Harmless, at least, as far as he...</l>
<l rend="right">But Dick --</l>
<l>Dick had n't found them harmless yesterday,</l>
<l>At breakfast, when he'd said he could n't stick</l>
<l>Eating dry bread, and crawled out the back way,</l>
<l>And brought them butter in a lordly dish --</l>
<l>Butter enough for all, and held it high,</l>
<l>Yellow and fresh and clean as you would wish --</l>
<l>When plump upon the plate from out the sky</l>
<l>A shell fell bursting... Where the butter went,</l>
<l>God only knew!...</l>
<l rend="right">And Dick... He dared not think</l>
<l>Of what had come to Dick... or what it meant --</l>
<l>The shrieking and the whistling and the stink</l>
<l>He'd lived in fourteen days and nights. 'T was luck</l>
<l>That he still lived... And queer how little then</l>
<l>He seemed to care that Dick... perhaps 't was pluck</l>
<l>That hardened him -- a man among the men --</l>
<l>Perhaps... Yet, only think things out a bit,</l>
<l>And he was rabbit-livered, blue with funk!</l>
<l>And he'd liked Dick... and yet when Dick was hit,</l>
<l>He hadn't turned a hair. The meanest skunk</l>
<l>He should have thought would feel it when his mate</l>
<l>Was blown to smithereens -- Dick, proud as punch,</l>
<l>Grinning like sin, and holding up the plate --</l>
<l>But he had gone on munching his dry hunch,</l>
<l>Unwinking, till he swallowed the last crumb.</l>
<pb n="210"/>
<l>Perhaps 't was just because he dared not let</l>
<l>His mind run upon Dick, who'd been his chum.</l>
<l>He dared not now, though he could not forget.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Dick took his luck. And, life or death, 't was luck</l>
<l>From first to last; and you'd just got to trust</l>
<l>Your luck and grin. It was n't so much pluck</l>
<l>As knowing that you'd got to, when needs must,</l>
<l>And better to die grinning...</l>
<l rend="right">Quiet now</l>
<l>Had fallen on the night. On either hand</l>
<l>The guns were quiet. Cool upon his brow</l>
<l>The quiet darkness brooded, as he scanned</l>
<l>The starry sky. He'd never seen before</l>
<l>So many stars. Although, of course, he'd known</l>
<l>That there were stars, somehow before the war</l>
<l>He'd never realised them -- so thick-sown,</l>
<l>Millions and millions. Serving in the shop,</l>
<l>Stars didn't count for much; and then at nights</l>
<l>Strolling the pavements, dull and fit to drop,</l>
<l>You didn't see much but the city lights.</l>
<l>He'd never in his life seen so much sky</l>
<l>As he'd seen this last fortnight. It was queer</l>
<l>The things war taught you. He'd a mind to try</l>
<l>To count the stars -- they shone so bright and clear.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>One, two, three, four... Ah, God, but he was tired...</l>
<l>Five, six, seven, eight...</l>
<l rend="right">Yes, it was number eight.</l>
<l>And what was the next thing that she required?</l>
<l>(Too bad of customers to come so late,</l>
<l>At closing time!) Again within the shop</l>
<pb n="211"/>
<l>He handled knots of tape and reels of thread,</l>
<l>Politely talking weather, fit to drop...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When once again the whole sky overhead</l>
<l>Flared blind with searchlights, and the shriek of shell</l>
<l>And scream of shrapnel roused him. Drowsily</l>
<l>He stared about him, wondering. Then he fell</l>
<l>Into deep dreamless slumber.</l></lg>

<milestone unit="stanza" rend="dots"/>

<lg>
<l rend="right">He could see</l>
<l>Two dark eyes peeping at him, ere he knew</l>
<l>He was awake, and it again was day --</l>
<l>An August morning, burning to clear blue.</l>
<l>The frightened rabbit scuttled...</l>
<l rend="right">Far away,</l>
<l>A sound of firing... Up there, in the sky</l>
<l>Big dragon-flies hung hovering... Snowballs burst</l>
<l>About them... Flies and snowballs. With a cry</l>
<l>He crouched to watch the airmen pass -- the first</l>
<l>That he'd seen under fire. Lord, that was pluck --</l>
<l>Shells bursting all about them -- and what nerve!</l>
<l>They took their chance, and trusted to their luck</l>
<l>At such a dizzy height to dip and swerve,</l>
<l>Dodging the shell-fire...</l>
<l rend="right">Hell! but one was hit,</l>
<l>And tumbling like a pigeon, plump...</l>
<l rend="right">Thank Heaven,</l>
<l>It righted, and then turned; and after it</l>
<l>The whole flock followed safe -- four, five, six, seven,</l>
<l>Yes, they were all there safe. He hoped they'd win</l>
<l>Back to their lines in safety. They deserved,</l>
<l>Even if they were Germans... 'T was no sin</l>
<pb n="212"/>
<l>To wish them luck. Think how that beggar swerved</l>
<l>Just in the nick of time!</l>
<l rend="right">He, too, must try</l>
<l>To win back to the lines, though, likely as not,</l>
<l>He'd take the wrong turn: but he could n't lie</l>
<l>Forever in that hungry hole and rot,</l>
<l>He'd got to take his luck, to take his chance</l>
<l>Of being sniped by foes or friends. He'd be</l>
<l>With any luck in Germany or France</l>
<l>Or Kingdom-come, next morning...</l>
<l rend="right">Drearily</l>
<l>The blazing day burnt over him, shot and shell</l>
<l>Whistling and whining ceaselessly. But light</l>
<l>Faded at last, and as the darkness fell</l>
<l>He rose, and crawled away into the night.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">(<hi rend="smallcap">After</hi> W. H. <hi rend="smallcap">Leatham's</hi> <hi rend="italic">The Comrade in White</hi>)</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Under</hi> our curtain of fire,</l>
<l>Over the clotted clods,</l>
<l>We charged, to be withered, to reel</l>
<l>And despairingly wheel</l>
<l>When the bugles bade us retire</l>
<l>From the terrible odds.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As we ebbed with the battle-tide,</l>
<l>Fingers of red-hot steel</l>
<l>Suddenly closed on my side.</l>
<l>I fell, and began to pray.</l>
<l>I crawled on my hands and lay</l>
<pb n="213"/>
<l>Where a shallow crater yawned wide;</l>
<l>Then, -- I swooned....</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When I woke, it was yet day.</l>
<l>Fierce was the pain of my wound,</l>
<l>But I saw it was death to stir,</l>
<l>For fifty paces away</l>
<l>Their trenches were.</l>
<l>In torture I prayed for the dark</l>
<l>And the stealthy step of my friend</l>
<l>Who, staunch to the very end,</l>
<l>Would creep to the danger zone</l>
<l>And offer his life as a mark</l>
<l>To save my own.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Night fell. I heard his tread,</l>
<l>Not stealthy, but firm and serene,</l>
<l>As if my comrade's head</l>
<l>Were lifted far from that scene</l>
<l>Of passion and pain and dread;</l>
<l>As if my comrade's heart</l>
<l>In carnage took no part;</l>
<l>As if my comrade's feet</l>
<l>Were set on some radiant street</l>
<l>Such as no darkness might haunt;</l>
<l>As if my comrade's eyes,</l>
<l>No deluge of flame could surprise,</l>
<l>No death and destruction daunt,</l>
<l>No red-beaked bird dismay,</l>
<l>Nor sight of decay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then in the bursting shells' dim light</l>
<l>I saw he was clad in white.</l>
<pb n="214"/>
<l>For a moment I thought that I saw the smock</l>
<l>Of a shepherd in search of his flock.</l>
<l>Alert were the enemy, too,</l>
<l>And their bullets flew</l>
<l>Straight at a mark no bullet could fail:</l>
<l>For the seeker was tall and his robe was bright;</l>
<l>But he did not flee nor quail.</l>
<l>Instead, with unhurrying stride</l>
<l>He came,</l>
<l>And gathering my tall frame,</l>
<l>Like a child, in his arms....</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Again I swooned,</l>
<l>And awoke</l>
<l>From a blissful dream</l>
<l>In a cave by a stream.</l>
<l>My silent comrade had bound my side.</l>
<l>No pain now was mine, but a wish that I spoke, --</l>
<l>A mastering wish to serve this man</l>
<l>Who had ventured through hell my doom to revoke,</l>
<l>As only the truest of comrades can.</l>
<l>I begged him to tell me how best I might aid him,</l>
<l>And urgently prayed him</l>
<l>Never to leave me, whatever betide;</l>
<l>When I saw he was hurt --</l>
<l>Shot through he hands that were clasped in prayer!</l>
<l>Then, as the dark drops gathered there</l>
<l>And fell in the dirt,</l>
<l>The wounds of my friend</l>
<l>Seemed to me such as no man might bear.</l>
<l>Those bullet-holes in the patient hands</l>
<l>Seemed to transcend</l>
<l>All horrors that ever these war-drenched lands</l>
<l>Had known or would know till the mad world's end.</l></lg>

<pb n="215"/>
<lg>
<l>Then suddenly I was aware</l>
<l>That his feet had been wounded, too;</l>
<l>And, dimming the white of his side,</l>
<l>A dull stain grew.</l>
<l>"You are hurt, White Comrade!" I cried.</l>
<l>His words I already foreknew:</l>
<l>"These are old wounds," said he,</l>
<l>"But of late they have troubled me."</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<head><hi rend="smallcap">The Wounded Canadian Speaks</hi>:</head>
<l n="1">My leg? It's off at the knee.</l>
<l>Do I miss it? Well, some. You see</l>
<l>I've had it since I was born;</l>
<l>And lately a devilish corn.</l>
<l>(I rather chuckle with glee</l>
<l>To think how I've fooled that corn.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I'll hobble around all right.</l>
<l>It is n't that, it's my face.</l>
<l>Oh, I know I'm a hideous sight,</l>
<l>Hardly a thing in place.</l>
<l>Sort of gargoyle, you'd say.</l>
<l>Nurse won't give me a glass,</l>
<l>But I see the folks as they pass</l>
<l>Shudder and turn away;</l>
<l>Turn away in distress...</l>
<l>Mirror enough, I guess.</l>
<l>I'm gay! You bet I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> gay,</l>
<l>But I was n't a while ago.</l>
<l>If you'd seen me even to-day,</l>
<pb n="216"/>
<l>The darnedest picture of woe,</l>
<l>With this Caliban mug of mine,</l>
<l>So ravaged and raw and red,</l>
<l>Turned to the wall -- in fine</l>
<l>Wishing that I was dead....</l>
<l>What has happened since then,</l>
<l>Since I lay with my face to the wall,</l>
<l>The most despairing of men!</l>
<l>Listen! I'll tell you all.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>That <hi rend="italic">poilu</hi> across the way,</l>
<l>With the shrapnel wound on his head,</l>
<l>Has a sister: she came to-day</l>
<l>To sit awhile by his bed.</l>
<l>All morning I heard him fret:</l>
<l>"Oh, when will she come, Fleurette?"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then sudden, a joyous cry;</l>
<l>The tripping of little feet;</l>
<l>The softest, tenderest sigh;</l>
<l>A voice so fresh and sweet;</l>
<l>Clear as a silver bell,</l>
<l>Fresh as the morning dews:</l>
<l rend="italic">"C'est toi, cest toi, Marcel!</l>
<l rend="italic">Mon fr&#x00E8;re, comme je suis heureuse!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So over the blanket's rim</l>
<l>I raised my terrible face,</l>
<l>And I saw -- how I envied him!</l>
<l>A girl of such delicate grace;</l>
<l>Sixteen, all laughter and love;</l>
<l>As gay as a linnet, and yet</l>
<l>As tenderly sweet as a dove;</l>
<l>Half woman, half child -- Fleurette.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="217"/>
<l>Then I turned to the wall again.</l>
<l>(I was awfully blue, you see,)</l>
<l>And I thought with a bitter pain:</l>
<l>"Such visions are not for me."</l>
<l>So there like a log I lay,</l>
<l>All hidden, I thought, from view,</l>
<l>When sudden I heard her say,</l>
<l>"Ah! Who is that <hi rend="italic">malheureux?</hi>"</l>
<l>Then briefly I heard him tell</l>
<l>(However he came to know)</l>
<l>How I'd smothered a bomb that fell</l>
<l>Into the trench, and so</l>
<l>None of my men were hit,</l>
<l>Though it busted me up a bit.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Well, I did n't quiver an eye,</l>
<l>And he chattered and there she sat;</l>
<l>And I fancied I heard her sigh --</l>
<l>But I would n't just swear that.</l>
<l>And maybe she was n't so bright,</l>
<l>Though she talked in a merry strain,</l>
<l>And I closed my eyes ever so tight,</l>
<l>Yet I saw her ever so plain:</l>
<l>Her dear little tilted nose,</l>
<l>Her delicate, dimpled chin,</l>
<l>Her mouth like a budding rose,</l>
<l>And the glistening pearls within;</l>
<l>Her eyes like the violet:</l>
<l>Such a rare little queen -- Fleurette.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And at last when she rose to go,</l>
<l>The light was a little dim,</l>
<l>And I ventured to peep, and so</l>
<l>I saw her, graceful and slim,</l>
<pb n="218"/>
<l>And she kissed him and kissed him, and oh</l>
<l>How I envied and envied him!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So when she was gone I said</l>
<l>In rather a dreary voice</l>
<l>To him of the opposite bed:</l>
<l>"Ah, friend, how you must rejoice!</l>
<l>But me, I'm a thing of dread.</l>
<l>For me nevermore the bliss</l>
<l>The thrill of a woman's kiss."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then I stopped, for lo! she was there,</l>
<l>And a great light shone in her eyes.</l>
<l>And me! I could only stare,</l>
<l>I was taken so by surprise,</l>
<l>When gently she bent her head:</l>
<l>"<hi rend="italic">May I kiss you, sergeant?</hi>" she said.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then she kissed my burning lips,</l>
<l>With her mouth like a scented flower,</l>
<l>And I thrilled to the finger-tips,</l>
<l>And I had n't even the power</l>
<l>To say: "God bless you, dear!"</l>
<l>And I felt such a precious tear</l>
<l>Fall on my withered cheek,</l>
<l>And darn it, I could n't speak.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And so she went sadly away,</l>
<l>And I know that my eyes were wet.</l>
<l>Ah, not to my dying day</l>
<l>Will I forget, forget!</l>
<l>Can you wonder now I am gay?</l>
<l>God bless her, that little Fleurette!</l></lg>

<l>And, in the midnight, in the breaking storm,</l>
<l rend="indent">I saw its blackness and a blinking light,</l>
<pb n="225"/>
<l>And thought, "So death obscures your gentle form,</l>
<l rend="indent">So memory strives to make the darkness bright;</l>
<l>And, in that heap of rocks, your body lies,</l>
<l rend="indent">Part of the island till the planet ends,</l>
<l>My gentle comrade, beautiful and wise,</l>
<l rend="indent">Part of this crag this bitter surge offends,</l>
<l>While I, who pass, a little obscure thing,</l>
<l>War with this force, and breathe, and am its king."</l></lg>

<l>England mourns for her dead across the sea.</l>
<l>Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,</l>
<l>Fallen in the cause of the free.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal</l>

<l>There is music in the midst of desolation</l>
<l>And a glory that shines upon our tears.</l></lg>

<l>They went with songs to the battle, they were young,</l>
<l>Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.</l>
<l>They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;</l>
<l>They fell with their faces to the foe.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old:</l>
<l>Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.</l>
<l>At the going down of the sun and in the morning</l>
<l>We will remember them.</l></lg>

<l>They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;</l>
<l>They sit no more at familiar tables of home;</l>
<l>They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;</l>
<l>They sleep beyond England's foam.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But where our desires are and our hopes profound,</l>
<l>Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,</l>
<l>To the innermost heart of their own land they are known</l>
<l>As the stars are known to the Night;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,</l>
<l>Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;</l>
<l>As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,</l>
<l>To the end, to the end, they remain.</l></lg>

<l>The teeming field, and darkly overstrewn</l>
<l>With all the garnered fullness of that noon --</l>

<l>One was a Woman, men had called their mother:</l>
<l>And one the Harvest Moon.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And one the Harvest Moon</l>
<l>Who stood, who gazed</l>
<l>On those unquiet gleanings, where they bled;</l>
<l>Till the lone Woman said:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"But we were crazed...</l>
<l>We should laugh now together, I and you;</l>
<l>We two.</l>
<l>You, for your ever dreaming it was worth</l>
<l>A star's while to look on, and light the earth;</l>
<l>And I, for ever telling to my mind</l>
<l>Glory it was and gladness, to give birth</l>
<l>To human kind.</l>
<l>I gave the breath, -- and thought it not amiss,</l>
<l>I gave the breath to men,</l>
<l>For men to slay again;</l>
<l>Lording it over anguish, all to give</l>
<l>My life, that men might live,</l>
<l>For this.</l></lg>

<l>Gave back the skies</l>
<l>A scattered upward stare</l>

<l>The furrowed field that lay</l>

<l>Of throbbing clay, -- but dumb and quiet soon,</l>

<l>The Harvest Moon.</l></lg>

<l>With a soldier I sat down.</l></lg>

<l>Beside another stream,</l>
<l>In his dark eyes extinguished</l>
<l>The friendship of his dream.</l></lg>

<l>Whose names on my lips are sealed...</l>

<l>Nor led upon the field</l></lg>

<l>Sons who lie dead at Li&#x00E8;ge,</l>

<l>Dead in southern mountains,</l>

<l>I stopped in the land of Louvain,</l>
<l>So tranquil, happy, then.</l>
<l>I lived with a good old woman,</l>
<l>With her sons and her grandchildren.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now they lie dead at Louvain,</l>

<l>In dreams she sees him dying</l>
<l>Of wounds, of heat, of thirst.</l></lg>

In 1912 he went to Paris and lived the life of a student and writer in the Latin Quarter. During the third week of the war he enlisted in the Foreign Legion of France. His service as a soldier was steady, loyal and uncomplaining -- indeed, exultant would not be too strong a word to describe the spirit which seems constantly to have animated his military career. He took part in the battle of Champagne. Afterwards, his regiment was allowed to recuperate until May, 1916. On July 1 a general advance was ordered, and on the evening of July 4 the Legion was ordered to attack the village of Belloy-en-Santerre. Seeger's squad was caught by the fire of six machine-guns and he himself was wounded in several places, but he continued to cheeer his comrades as they rushed on in what proved a successful charge. He died on the morning of July 5. The twenty or more poems he wrote during active service are included in the collected <hi rend="italic">Poems by Alan Seeger</hi>, with an Introduction by William Archer.</p>
