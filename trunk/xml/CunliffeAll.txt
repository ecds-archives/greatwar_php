When last heard from, the author, who is a British officer, was on service at Khartoum.</note>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">B<hi rend="smallcaps">ehind</hi> us in vermilion state</l>
<l>The sun fell to the rustling sea,</l>
<l>The grey-green twilight came and went,</l>
<l>And night involved my friend and me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now Egypt donned her fairest robes</l>
<l>Of glimmering moonshine cool and clear:</l>
<l>No more we talked, and silently</l>
<l>Made o'er the waste to Abu Qir.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For, with the twilight, twilight dreams</l>
<l>Had come and borne our souls away,</l>
<l>Though still our bodies onward fared</l>
<l>Toward the palm-trees and the bay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And my companion now, I think,</l>
<l>With brother-artists once again</l>
<l>Was painting in the atelier,</l>
<l>Or down some dear Parisian lane</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="2"/>
<l>Was seeking with a motley throng</l>
<l>That well-remembered brasserie,</l>
<l>And Trilby, hanging on his arm,</l>
<l>Was laughing at him merrily.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I, ah, where was I? Afar</l>
<l>I'd flown to that enchanted shore,</l>
<l>Where o'er white-flashing waves the wind</l>
<l>From Donegal to Mullaghmore</l>
<l>Comes gallivanting bold and free --</l>
<l rend="indent">God grant again I there may be,</l>
<l rend="indent">At Mullaghmore, with Rosalind.</l></lg>

<l rend="italic">England's cheeky kid brother,</l>
<l rend="italic">Who bloodily assaulted your august elder</l>
<l rend="italic">At Bunker Hill and similar places</l>
<l rend="italic">(Not mentioned in our history books),</l>
<l rend="italic">What can I tell you of war or of peace?</l>

<l rend="italic">Bull Run, Gettysburg, Fredericksburg?</l>
<l rend="italic">Your million dead?</l>
<l rend="italic">Tell me,</l>
<l rend="italic">Was that the greatest time of your lives</l>
<l rend="italic">Or the most disastrous?</l>
<l rend="italic">Who knows? Not you; not I.</l>
<l rend="italic">Who can tell the end of this war?</l>
<l rend="italic">And say, brother Jonathan,</l>
<l rend="italic">D'you know what it's all about?</l>
<l rend="italic">Let me whisper you a secret -- we don't!</l>
<l rend="italic">We were all too fat with peace,</l>
<l rend="italic">Or perhaps we didn't quite know how good peace was,</l>
<l rend="italic">And so here we are,</l>
<l rend="italic">And we're going to win....</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It's fine to be a soldier,</l>
<l>To get accepted by the recruiting sergeant,</l>
<pb n="4"/>
<l>Be trained, fitted with a uniform and a gun,</l>
<l>Say good-bye to your girl,</l>
<l>And go off to the front</l>
<l>Whistling, "It's a long way to Tipperary."</l>
<l>It's good to march forty miles a day,</l>
<l>Carrying ninety-one pounds on your back,</l>
<l>To eat good coarse food, get blistered, tired out, wounded,</l>
<l>Thirst, starve, fight like a devil</l>
<l>(<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, like you an' me, Jonathan),</l>
<l>With the Maxims zip-zipping</l>
<l>And the shrapnel squealing,</l>
<l>And the howitzers rumbling like the traffic in Piccadilly.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Civilization? --</l>
<l>Jonathan, if you could hear them</l>
<l>Whistling the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Marching Through Georgia</hi>,</l>
<l>You'd want to go too.</l>
<l>Twenty thousand a day, Jonathan!</l>
<l>Perhaps you're more civilized just now than we are,</l>
<l>Perhaps we've only forgotten civilization for a moment,</l>
<l>Perhaps we're really fighting for peace.</l>
<l>And after all it will be more fun afterwards --</l>
<l>More fun for the poets and the painters --</l>
<l>When the cheering's all over</l>
<pb n="5"/>
<l>And the dead men buried</l>
<l>And the rest gone back to their jobs.</l>
<l>It'll be more fun for them to make their patterns,</l>
<l>Their word-patterns and color-patterns.</l>
<l>And after all, there is always war and always peace,</l>
<l>Always the war of the crowds,</l>
<l>Always the great peace of the arts.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Even now,</l>
<l>With the war beating in great waves overhead,</l>
<l>Beating and roaring like great winds and mighty waters,</l>
<l>The sea-gods still pattern the red seaweed fronds,</l>
<l>Still chip the amber into neck-chains</l>
<l>For Leucothea and Thetis.</l>
<l>Even now,</l>
<l>When the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> screams like a hurt woman,</l>
<l>And Paris -- grisette among cities -- trembles with fear,</l>
<l>The poets still make their music</l>
<l>Which nobody listens to,</l>
<l>Which hardly anyone ever listened to.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The great crowds go by,</l>
<l>Fighting over each other's bodies in peace-time,</l>
<l>Fighting over each other's bodies in war-time.</l>
<l>Something of the strife comes to them</l>
<l>In their little, high rock-citadel of art,</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>Where they hammer their dreams in gold and copper,</l>
<l>Where they cut them in pine-wood, in Parian stone, in wax,</l>
<l>Where they sing them in sweet bizarre words</l>
<l>To the sound of antiquated shrill instruments;</l>
<l>And they are happy.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The little rock-citadel of the artists</l>
<l>Is always besieged;</l>
<l>There, though they have beauty and silence,</l>
<l>They have always tears and hunger and despair.</l>
<l>But that little citadel has held out</l>
<l>Against all the wars of the world</l>
<l>Like England, brother Jonathan.</l>
<l>It will not fall during the great war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There is always war and always peace;</l>
<l>Always the war of the crowds,</l>
<l>Always the great peace of the arts.</l>

<l>Forsaken loves of faithless bees,</l>

<head rend="center">UNSER GOTT</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">T<hi rend="smallcaps">hey</hi> held a great prayer-service in Berlin,</l>
<l>And augured German triumph from some words</l>
<l>Said to be spoken by the Jewish God</l>
<l>To Gideon, which signified that He</l>
<l>Was staunchly partial to the Israelites.</l>
<l>The aisles were thronged; and in the royal box</l>
<l>(I had it from a tourist who was there,</l>
<l>Clutching her passport, anxious, like the rest),</l>
<l>There sat the Kaiser, looking "very sad."</l>
<l>And then they sang; she said it shook the heart.</l>
<l>The women sobbed; tears salted bearded lips</l>
<l>Unheeded; and my friend looked back and saw</l>
<l>A young girl crumple in her mother's arms.</l>
<l>They carried out a score of them, she said,</l>
<l>While German hearts, through bursting German throats</l>
<l>Poured out, <hi rend="italic">Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott!</hi></l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Yea, "Unser Gott! Our strength is <hi rend="italic">Unser</hi> Gott!</l>
<l>Not that light-minded Bon Dieu of France!")</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I think we all have made our God too small.</l>
<l>There was a young man, a good while ago,</l>
<pb n="12"/>
<l>Who taught that doctrine... but they murdered him</l>
<l>Because he wished to share the Jewish God</l>
<l>With other folk.</l>
<l rend="indent18">They are long-lived, these fierce</l>
<l>Old hating Gods of nations; but at last</l>
<l>There surely will be spilled enough of blood</l>
<l>To drown them all! The deeps of sea and air,</l>
<l>Of old the seat of gods, no more are safe,</l>
<l>For mines and monoplanes. The Germans, now,</l>
<l>Can surely find and rout the God of France</l>
<l>With Zeppelins, or some slim mother's son</l>
<l>Of Paris, or of Tours, or Brittany,</l>
<l>Can drop a bomb into the <hi rend="italic">Feste Burg</hi>,</l>
<l>And, having crushed the source of German strength,</l>
<l>Die happy in his blazing monoplane.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Sad jesting! If there be no God at all,</l>
<l>Save in the heart of man, why, even so --</l>
<l>Yea, all the more, -- since we must make our God,</l>
<l>Oh, let us make Him large enough for all,</l>
<l>Or cease to prate of Him! If kings must fight,</l>
<l>Let them fight for their glory, openly,</l>
<l>And plain men for their lands and for their homes,</l>
<l>And heady youths, who go to see the fun,</l>
<l>Blaspheme not God. True, maybe we might leave</l>
<l>The God of Germany to some poor frau</l>
<l>Who cannot go, who can but wait and mourn,</l>
<pb n="13"/>
<l>Except that she will teach Him to her sons --</l>
<l>A God quite scornful of the Slavic soul,</l>
<l>And much concerned to keep Alsace-Lorraine.</l>
<l>They should go godless, too -- the poor, benumbed</l>
<l>Crushed, anguished women, till their hearts can hold</l>
<l>A greater Comforter!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent22">(Yet it is hard</l>
<l>To make Him big enough! For me, I like</l>
<l>The English and the Germans and the French,</l>
<l>The Russians, too; and Servians, I should think,</l>
<l>Might well be very interesting to God.</l>
<l>But, do the best I may, my God is white,</l>
<l>And hardly takes a nigger seriously</l>
<l>This side of Africa. Not those, at least</l>
<l>Who steal my wood, and of a summer night</l>
<l>Keep me awake with shouting, where they sit</l>
<l>With monkey-like fidelity and glee</l>
<l>Grinding through their well-oiled sausage-mill --</l>
<l>The dead machinery of the white man's church --</l>
<l>Raw jungle-fervor, mixed with scraps sucked dry</l>
<l>Of Israel's old sublimities: not those.</l>
<l>And when they threaten us, the Higher Race,</l>
<l>Think you, which side is God's? Oh, let us pray</l>
<l>Lest blood yet spurt to wash that black skin white,</l>
<l>As now it flows because a German hates</l>
<l>A Cossack, and an Austrian a Serb!)</l>
<pb n="14"/>
<l>What was it that he said so long ago,</l>
<l>The young man who outgrew the Jewish God --</l>
<l>"Not a sparrow falleth --?" Ah, God, God,</l>
<l>And there shall fall a million murdered men!</l>

<head rend="center">The sky flowers</l>
<l>All day.</l>
<l>Strange mechanical birds</l>
<l>With struts of wire and glazed wings</l>
<l>Cross the impassive sky</l>
<l>Which burgeons ever and again</l>
<l>With ephemeral unfolding flowers,</l>
<l>White and yellow and brown,</l>
<l>That spread and dissolve.</l>
<l>And smaller rapid droning birds go by,</l>
<l>And bright metallic bees whose sting is death.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behind the hills,</l>
<l>Behind the whispering woods whose leaves are falling</l>
<l>Yellow and red to cover the red clay,</l>
<l>Misshapen monsters squat with wide black maws</l>
<l>Gulping smoke and belching flame.</l>
<l>From the mirk reed beds of the age of coal,</l>
<l>Wallowing out of their sleep in the earlier slime,</l>
<l>They are resurrected and stagger forth to slay --</l>
<l>The prehistoric Beasts we thought were dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="18"/>
<l>They are blinded with long sleep,</l>
<l>But men with clever weapons</l>
<l>Goad them to fresh pastures.</l>
<l>Beside still waters</l>
<l>They drink of blood and neigh a horrible laughter,</l>
<l>And their ponderous tread shakes happy cities down,</l>
<l>And the thresh of their flail-like tails</l>
<l>Makes acres smoulder and smoke</l>
<l>Blackened of golden harvest.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The Beasts are back,</l>
<l>And men, in their spreading shadow,</l>
<l>Inhale the odor of their nauseous breath.</l>
<l>Inebriate with it they fashion other gods</l>
<l>Than the gods of day-dream.</l>
<l>Of iron and steel are little images</l>
<l>Made of the Beasts.</l>
<l>And men rush forth and fling themselves for ritual</l>
<l>Before these gods, before the lumbering Beasts, --</l>
<l>And some make long obeisance.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Umber and violet flowers of the sky,</l>
<l>The sun, like a blazing Mars, clanks across the blue</l>
<l>And plucks you, to fashion into a nosegay</l>
<l>To offer Venus, his old-time paramour.</l>
<l>But now she shrinks</l>
<pb n="19"/>
<l>And pales</l>
<l>Like Cynthia, her more ascetic sister...</l>
<l>Vulcan came to her arms in the grimy garb</l>
<l>Of toil, he smelt of the forge and the racketing workshop,</l>
<l>But not of blood.</l>
<l>And, if she smells these flowers, they bubble ruby blood</l>
<l>That trickles between her fingers.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet is a dream flowing over the red country,</l>
<l>Yet is a light growing, for all the black furrows of the red country...</l>
<l>The machines are foe or friend</l>
<l>As the world desires.</l>
<l>The Beasts shall sleep again.</l>
<l>And in that sleep, when the land is twilight-still</l>
<l>And men take thought among the frozen waves of the dead,</l>
<l>The Sowers go forth once more,</l>
<l>Sowers of vision, sowers of the seed</l>
<l>Of peace or war.</l>
<l>Shall it be peace indeed?</l>
<l>Great shadowy figures moving from hill to hill</l>
<l>Of tangled bodies, with rhythmic stride and cowled averted head,</l>
<l>What do you sow with hands funereal --</l>
<l>New savageries imperial,</l>
<pb n="20"/>
<l>Unthinking pomps for arrogant, witless men?</l>
<l>Or seed for the people in strong democracy?</l>
<l>What do you see</l>
<l>With your secret eyes, and sow for us, that we must reap again?</l></lg>

<l>Smelling of wide-extending marshes of hay;</l>
<l>Smelling of cornfields;</l>
<l>Smelling of apple-orchards;</l>
<l>Smelling of cherry-trees in full blossom;</l>
<l>Smelling of all the pleasant recollections of my childhood --</l>

<l>Grandmother's plum-pudding --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<pb n="33"/>
<l>I see before me a lane running between two rows of straggling cottages --</l>
<l>I cannot remember the name of the lane;</l>
<l>I do not know whether it has any name at all;</l>
<l>But I remember it was broad and unpaven and shaded with wide-branching chestnuts --</l>
<l>And enters the market-place</l>
<l>Just a few houses after my Grandfather's --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see it even now</l>
<l>My Grandfather's house --</l>
<l>On the lane, to the right, as you come from the market-place;</l>
<l>A big, hospitable frame building --</l>
<l>Big like my Grandfather's own heart,</l>
<l>And hospitable like Grandmother's smile --</l>
<l>I can see it even now,</l>
<l>With the white-pillared porch in the centre and the sharp-gabled roof</l>
<l>Pierced with little windows;</l>
<l>And the great quadrangular garden behind it;</l>
<l>And the tall fence surrounding the garden;</l>
<l>And the old well in the corner of the garden;</l>
<l>With the bucket-lift</l>
<l>Rising over the fence --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<l>I can see him even now,</l>
<l>My Grandfather --</l>
<l>Bending over me, tall and sad-eyed and thoughtful</l>
<l>Lifting me up and seating me on his knees</l>
<l>Lovingly,</l>
<l>And listening to all my childish questions and confessions;</l>
<l>Pardoning, admonishing, remonstrating --</l>
<l>Satisfying my interrogative soul with good-humored indulgence --</l>
<l>And my Grandmother,</l>
<l>Dear little woman!</l>
<l>I can never dissociate her from plum-pudding and apple dumplings,</l>
<l>And raisin-cakes and almond cakes and crisp potato pancakes</l>
<l>And the smell of fish frying on the fire --</l>
<l>And then there is my cousin, Miriam,</l>
<l>Who lived in the yellow house across the lane --</l>
<l>A freckle-faced, cherry-eyed little girl with a puckered-up nose.</l>
<l>I was very romantic about her;</l>
<l>And then there is my curse, my rival at school, my arch-enemy --</l>
<l>Jacob,</l>
<l>The synagogue sexton's boy,</l>
<l>On whom 1 was always warring --</l>
<pb n="35"/>
<l>God knows on what battlefield he must be lying now!</l>
<l>And then there is Nathan and Joseph and Berel and Solomon</l>
<l>And Ephraim, the baker's boy,</l>
<l>And Baruch and Gershen and Mendel</l>
<l>And long-legged, sandy-haired Emanuel who fell into the pond with me that time,</l>
<l>While we were skating on the ice --</l>

<lg>
<l>I can see myself even now</l>
<l>In the lane on a summer's day,</l>
<l>Cap in hand, chasing after dragon-flies --</l>
<l>Suddenly, near by, sounds the noise of drums and bugles --</l>
<l>I know what that means!</l>
<l>Breathlessly I dash up the lane --</l>
<l>It is the regiment quartered in the barracks at the end of the town, in its annual parade on the highway --</l>
<l>How I would wish to be one of those gray-coated heroes!</l>
<l>I watch them eager-eyed --</l>
<l>And run after them until they reach the Gentile Quarter --</l>
<l>And then I turn back --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="36"/>
<l>I am in the market-place --</l>
<l>At a Fair;</l>
<l>The market-place is a heaving mass of carts and horses and oxen;</l>
<l>The oxen are lowing, the horses are neighing, the peasants are cursing in a dozen different dialects --</l>
<l>I am in Grandfather's store,</l>
<l>On the lower end of the market-place, right opposite the public well --</l>
<l>The store is full of peasants and peasant women, bargaining at the top of their voices;</l>
<l>The men are clad in rough sheepskin coats and fur caps;</l>
<l>The women are gay in bright-colored cottons and wear red kerchiefs around their heads;</l>
<l>My Grandfather is standing behind the counter measuring out rope to some peasants;</l>
<l>Grandmother is cutting a strip of linen for a peasant woman, chaffering with another one at the same time, about the price of a pair of sandals --</l>
<l>And I am sitting there, behind the counter, on a sack of flour,</l>
<l>Playing with my black-eyed little cousin --</l></lg>

<head rend="center">When the war was over</l>
<l>Came the young men slowly with an air of being old,</l>
<l>On a morning blue and gold</l>
<l>Through the weed-grown meadow-places</l>
<l>Marched young soldiers with old faces,</l>
<l>Marched the columns of the Emperor with dull, bewildered eyes,</l>

<lg>
<l>A woman knelt in a garden by the road,</l>
<l rend="indent">Patting a little mound of earth</l>
<l>With aimless hands. Along the highway flowed</l>
<l rend="indent">The gray tide, while the day was at its birth.</l>
<l>She heard the drums, looked up, half smiled:</l>
<l rend="indent">"Why do you march," she said, "and play at soldiers?</l>

<l rend="indent">Old men grouped by their fright, ran here and there</l>

<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcaps">went</hi> out into the night of quiet stars;</l>
<l>I looked up at the wheeling heavens, at the mysterious firmament;</l>
<l>I thought of the awful distances out there, of the incredible magnitudes, of space and silence and eternity;</l>
<l>I thought of man, his life, his love, his dream;</l>
<l>I thought of his body, how it is born and grows, and of his spirit that cannot be explained.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>All about me slept the land in peace, and nature slept in deep serenity;</l>
<l>An off-shore wind had died at sunset, the bay was calm and golden as twilight fell;</l>
<l>Not a cloud broke the clear and tender blue of the evening sky.</l>
<l>Then the quiet stars came out, the air grew cool with the breath of night;</l>
<l>A land-breeze flurried, wafting the odor of damp woods and late hay-fields;</l>
<l>A gentle breeze, that scarcely turned the sleeping leaves.</l>
<pb n="59"/>
<l>I walked on through the village, I saw the lights go out in houses as men and women prepared for bed;</l>
<l>Safe and secure, the homes of my neighbors rested in the shadow of tall trees, that had been growing there peacefully a long time;</l>
<l>I passed on into the country, crickets were singing in the fields, fireflies were glimmering in the pastures among low growths of spruce and pine;</l>
<l>I mounted a hill, high overhead brooded the majestic and silent heavens;</l>
<l>On the eastern horizon a great bright star arose, casting a track across the bay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I have never seen the world so calm, the air so clear and still;</l>
<l>I have never known an hour so full of quietness.</l></lg>

<lg>

<l rend="italic">Hour of the War!</l>
<l rend="italic">Now, now -- and here -- on this same earth, and under this same sky!</l>
<l rend="italic">Now! -- Now! -- The War! -- The War! -- The War!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Night, and a sodden field, and starlight over all,</l>
<l>And on the ground the bodies of dead men lying;</l>
<pb n="60"/>
<l>Tumbled, broken, grotesque, in attitudes unhuman, in lumpish, swollen heaps, they lie,</l>
<l>Where death suddenly snatched them up and flung them down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A strange, dark, silent scene;</l>
<l>Here passed the awful charge three days ago;</l>
<l>Here met the choking volley, shattered out and fell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Three days and nights they have been lying here;</l>
<l>No help could reach them, cast between the battle lines;</l>
<l>No help is needed now.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Slowly above their heads the conflict wore itself away;</l>
<l>Calm settled on the shaking, riven air;</l>
<l>The sharp cries of the wounded stopped one by one, their groans grew fainter;</l>
<l>A few crawled off -- the others lay as they had fallen, under the sun and stars;</l>
<l>Then the third night, and peace at last, the quietness restored.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">3.</head>
<l>Listen! -- could one be living? -- come this way;</l>
<l>Here where a score of bodies are drawn mysteriously together,</l>
<l>A turning face catches a gleam of starlight,</l>
<l>A hand moves, winnowing the air.</l>
<pb n="61"/>
<l><hi rend="italic">"Water!"</hi> -- No use, no use -- too late;</l>
<l>His breast is shot away -- don't move him -- God, how he bled!</l>
<l>What is it, comrade? A letter -- make a light:</l>
<l rend="italic">"We have not heard since you left home.... I cannot bear it...."</l>
<l>Turn the sheet over: -- <hi rend="italic">"Oh, my dear, be careful!"</hi></l>
<l>Here is the signature -- the address -- a distant village;</l>
<l>I have been there -- an ancient, quiet village of the north,</l>
<l>Fronting the open sea.</l>
<l>Yes, comrade, I will write -- he smiles:</l>
<l>To lie here, thinking, suffering, remembering;</l>
<l>To be left to die alone!</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">4.</head>
<l>But not alone:</l>
<l>Passing brother, you have yet a grim companion;</l>
<l>Along the edge of the thicket just now, as I went to the brook down there for water,</l>
<l>I stumbled over something that must have been left from the charge a week ago:</l>
<l>A body that held the remnants of a man.</l>
<l>He had dragged himself to the brook, he lay imbedded in tall waving grass;</l>
<l>His stomach had been ripped open by shrapnel, maggots were heaving in the wound</l>
<pb n="62"/>
<l>(Did you know that a man could live while maggots formed in his flesh?)</l>
<l>His muscles twitched convulsively, he was barely conscious;</l>
<l>He did not notice the match I struck, his eyes were filmed over, he would not drink;</l>
<l>The region that he inhabited was an unknown, unimaginable land.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(At home, a woman waits for news of him:</l>
<l>It is well that she can never hear.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">5.</head>
<l>Pass on, pass on! Behold the mobilization of armies;</l>
<l>The men leaving their work at the counter and factory, dropping the plow where it stands in the field,</l>
<l>Flocking together, filling the towns, saying good-by to wife and children, taking a last look around;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold the flinging forward of nations in the wake of armies;</l>
<l>The marvellous, massive engines, the enormous paraphernalia;</l>
<l>The powerful mechanical conveyances, the long lines of them carrying supplies;</l>
<pb n="63"/>
<l>The immense stores of provisions at the depot, the stacks of clothing and other necessities, the huge piles of fodder and grain for the horses;</l>
<l>The flaring illuminations, the sweating gangs working beneath them, ceaselessly receiving, sorting, distributing;</l>
<l>The field guns, the heavy artillery, their ponderous steady movements through the villages;</l>
<l>The stout-wheeled wagons full of dangerous, costly ammunition;</l>
<l>The roaring trains, arriving and departing, some laden with supplies, some packed with humanity, alive or dead;</l>
<l>The vast and systematic commissariat, the grist of war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">6.</head>
<l>Behold the columns, advancing, advancing, advancing;</l>
<l>Tramping steadily onward, seen behind on the hills, and seen ahead to the distant turn of the road;</l>
<l>Streaming along the valleys, gaining and crossing the passes, flanking the mountain ranges, netting the land with a lethal web;</l>
<l>Accoutrements flashing and jangling, thunder of tread, regular motion swaying and undulating the lines;</l>
<pb n="64"/>
<l>Countless miles of indomitable marching men;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold the front, the million-manned intrenchments, continent-spanning;</l>
<l>The infinite detail of day-works and night-works;</l>
<l>The burrowing, roofing, screening, the placing of barbed-wire entanglements;</l>
<l>The stealthy advance in the darkness, the hasty and desperate digging-in under fire;</l>
<l>The shifting and rushing forward of artillery, the lashing of horses, the running of wires for communication;</l>
<l>The searchlights feeling afar through the night, like cold white fingers;</l>
<l>The life of the trenches, after all is completed;</l>
<l>The hidden underground chambers, the well-concealed passages, the bomb-proof quarters;</l>
<l>The men laughing and singing, some of them making music on simple instruments, some playing cards, some smoking and talking;</l>
<l>Passing backwards and forwards, eating, sleeping, fighting, or taking their leisure, all out of sight, in tunnels and cavities below the surface:</l>
<l>A serious new game for earnest, grown-up children.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Hark, hark! Aloft -- look up;</l>
<l>A great bird sails across the sky, with loud and strident whirr of wings;</l>
<pb n="65"/>
<l>Terribly swift -- a moment -- it is gone.</l>
<l>Can men be passing there on high, so swiftly through the air?)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">7.</head>
<l>Pass on! Behold the charge;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Ready! Run low! Run wide!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l>
<l>Over the open fields, trampling the crops, dropping to fire, rising to run;</l>
<l>(Some never rising, never again to rise;)</l>
<l>Straggling, thinning, wavering, (God, it is hopeless! -- it is too much!)</l>
<l>Onward, onward pressing, rushing and driving onward;</l>
<l>(I did not know that men could be so reckless and brave!)</l>
<l>Mounting the opposite slope, cutting their way through entanglements;</l>
<l>Gaining the outer trenches, (deadly work for the bayonets!)</l>
<l>Shouting, cursing, groaning, stabbing, wrestling, clubbing with butts, fighting at last with bare fists;</l>
<l>Annihilating the enemy, capturing the position!</l>
<l rend="italic">(Victory! Victory! Victory!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l>
<pb n="66"/>
<l>(On the open field lie many huddled shapes;</l>
<l>The wounded are stirring feebly out there, like men awaking from a violent dream;</l>
<l>They lift their heads, they stretch their arms, they struggle to rise on their elbows;</l>
<l>They sit up, staring around -- they crawl like snails among the crops;</l>
<l>A screaming horse dashes athwart the line, dragging his entrails on the ground.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">8.</head>
<l>Behold the ships at sea;</l>
<l>A long and weary time they had been waiting, constantly on the alert, nerves strained to breaking;</l>
<l>In smothering, foggy weather, in gloomy days, in pitch-black nights, in wild and desperate gales;</l>
<l>Anxious for battle, longing to sight the enemy, every one on the lookout, chafing and growling;</l>
<l>Anything, anything, boys, to end this tedious monotony!</l>
<l>(Maybe an unseen deliverer is at hand.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The captain was walking the bridge that morning, the crew were at breakfast, the navigating officer was winding his chronometers;</l>
<l>Suddenly, from forward, a frantic cry! A man runs aft, pointing to windward;</l>
<l>The captain whips out his glasses, scans the horizon;</l>
<pb n="67"/>
<l>For a while, he does not pick up a little white streak on the water, not very far away, drawing rapidly nearer;</l>
<l>A streak like the wake of a shark's fin, cutting along on the weather bow.</l>
<l>He sees it! Quick, to the signal! <hi rend="italic">Stop! Full speed astern!</hi></l>
<l rend="italic">Over, there, with the helm!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Too late, too late, captain of ship and lives;</l>
<l>Away from the little wake springs a broader wake;</l>
<l>A murderous fish drives straight towards you, churning the water as he goes.</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Close compartment doors!</hi> -- the last command;</l>
<l>Then to the end of the bridge, and stand there waiting;</l>
<l>Press tight the lips, fold the arms on the breast, throw back the head:</l>
<l>Below, along the weather rail, a line of men stands silently, watching death come;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A whitish object skims on the surface of the blue sea;</l>
<l>The torpedo strikes below the magazine;</l>
<l>The ship is instantly blown in two -- she sinks like lead;</l>
<l>A faint cheer finds no listener but God.</l>
<pb n="68"/>
<l>A few men struggle on the water, where she went down;</l>
<l>They cling for a while to fragments of wreckage;</l>
<l>There is no help in sight -- they cannot be saved.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Down in the close, tight shell -- in the unseen, mysterious vessel,</l>
<l>Crouching in a dim chamber, in utter silence, wrapped in impenetrable privacy, apart from life, cut off from world of land and sea,</l>
<l>A man sits, breathing hard, clenching his hands;</l>
<l>Far above him, where sunlight strikes on breaking wave, a secret eye looks out,</l>
<l>A secret mirror throws down to him the story there;</l>
<l>One long, intense, absorbing glance -- then to the signal stretches out his hand;</l>
<l>Turning away, as darkly as she came, the submarine speeds homeward,</l>
<l>Leaving the sea to seal her work and bury her dead.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">9.</head>
<l>Behold! Hour of the War!</l>
<l>Life everywhere flowing in strange new channels!</l>
<l>The world aroused, awakened! The silence rent! Peace shattered and overthrown!</l>
<l>The well-ordered conventions rudely broken up! The illusions dissipated! The motives suddenly disclosed!</l>
<pb n="69"/>
<l>Men face to face with nature, death, and pain! The elemental shown! And dim and far, the truth appearing!</l>
<l>The hovering dream I The distant and divine conception!</l>
<l>(I sing no battles lost, retreating armies:</l>
<l>O, I tell you, in this campaign there are no defeats!</l>
<l>O, I tell you, the retreating and advancing armies are equally triumphant!</l>
<l>O, I tell you, the lost battles contribute as much as the battles won, to the sure result of this campaign!</l>
<l rend="italic">Victory! Victory! Victory!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<l>While about me sleeps the land in peace, while men and women prepare for bed;</l>
<l>While the land-breeze flurries, wafting a scent of autumn woods and fallen leaves;</l>
<l>While the crickets sing in the fields, and fireflies glimmer among low spruce and pine;</l>
<l>While the bright star rises, casting a track across the bay;</l>
<l>While the majestic heavens wheel onward, overlooking space and time;</l>
<l>While the still air drops down its quietness like love.</l></lg>

<l>The tide passed, and the waves came and whispered about his ankles.</l>
