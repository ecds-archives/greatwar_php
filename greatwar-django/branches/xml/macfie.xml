<head>i</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>SPINNING in space, a filmy cloudlet shone</l>
<l>Festooned and frayed,</l>
<l>Like a torn braid</l>
<l>Of woven pearls and silver--thin and wan</l>
<l>As tenuous ghosts that in the saffron dawn</l>
<l>Upon the sweltry banks of Acheron</l>
<l>Swither and sway. And ever and anon</l>
<l>Out of the margin of the mist there came</l>
<l>Flurries of flame</l>
<l>And drifts of scarlet scud,</l>
<l>As if of glairy tears, and clotted blood,</l>
<l>Together spun--</l>
<l>Spindrift and spume of the vortiginous surge</l>
<l>Of a sun-shattered sun,</l>



<pb n="2   War: An Ode"/>

<l>Around whose fiery wrack was furled the cloud.</l>
<l>Like swaddling robes, or bridal veil, or shroud.</l></lg></div>

<div id="macfie002" type="section" n="2">
<head>ii</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>So seethed the cloud, and reeling from the gurge,</l>
<l>Smelted and smoothened from the rough d&#x00E9;bris</l>
<l>By the hot hands of Fire, the Thaumaturge,</l>
<l>The Earth leapt free.</l></lg>

<milestone unit="section" rend="stars"/>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Around it, burned and boomed a plangent sea</l>
<l>That ever by the cruel knotted scourge</l>
<l>Of a wild crashing rain of crimson scree</l>
<l>Was whipped to plashing whirls of purple foam.</l>
<l>And ever lashing from its d&#x00E6;dal dome</l>
<l>There hissed a heavy hail of falling stars</l>
<l>Whose flick upon the lava's filigree</l>
<l>Made rosy scars.</l>
<l>And ever from the coastal crust of slag</l>
<l>Slipped candent cliff and burning crag</l>
<l>Into the cauldron of the bubbling ore,</l>

<pb n="War: An Ode  3"/>

<l>And steamed and wallowed in the red fiords</l>
<l>Like monstrous hordes</l>
<l>Of snorting dragons weltering in gore,</l>
<l>Stabbed in the loins with the long jagg&#x00E8;d swords</l>
<l>Of the livid lightning.   Yea, and evermore</l>
<l>Came from volcano-throats the raucous roar</l>
<l>Of lava and of thunder; and the shore</l>
<l>Reverberated with the ponderous tide</l>
<l>As the sun rose in reckless wrath and tore</l>
<l>--Till  the  astounded  stars heard  the torn granite gride--</l>
<l>The bossy, slaggy moon from the Earth's riven side.</l></lg></div>

<div id="macfie003" type="section" n="3">
<head>iii</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Still the hoarse thunder bellowed, still the fire</l>
<l>Moulded to its desire</l>
<l>Mountain and swire,</l>
<l>And precipice and dale,</l>
<l>So porphyry pinnacle and granite spire</l>
<l>Guttered and sagged like candles in a gale;</l>
<l>And basalt towers</l>
<l>Wilted like flowers</l>

<pb n="4  War: An Ode"/>

<l>In scorching showers</l>
<l>Of radiant hail;</l>
<l>And the crust moaned</l>
<l>And groaned</l>
<l>And rose and fell</l>
<l>Like the hot surges in the heart of hell.</l>
<l>But round the planet in &#x00E6;therial space</l>
<l>There lurked a frost that gripped it like a vice</l>
<l>A frost so fierce could curdle flame to ice--</l>
<l>The frost of nothingness that never knew</l>
<l>A genial flush of warmth come burning through</l>
<l>Its deadly limbus.   In its dire embrace</l>
<l>The furnaces of fire forgot to glow;</l>
<l>And from the welkin dun,</l>
<l>Unlighted by the sun,</l>
<l>A clattering clinker fell of iron snow.</l></lg></div>

<div id="macfie004" type="section" n="4">
<head>iv</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>And from the white becloud&#x00E8;d skies,</l>
<l>Like scalding tears.</l>
<l>From clos&#x00E8;d eyes,</l>
<l>Held shut by fears,</l>


<pb n="War: An Ode  5"/>

<l>Gripped tight by pain,</l>
<l>There trickled through</l>
<l>A drench of dew,</l>
<l>An ooze of tepid rain,</l>
<l>And down the smouldering hills,</l>
<l>Gather, by slow accrue,</l>
<l>A leash of little rills,</l>
<l>Amber and blue.</l></lg>
</div>

<div id="macfie005" type="section" n="5">
<head>v</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>And rills became a stream,</l>
<l>And streams to rivers grew,</l>
<l>And in a cloud of steam</l>
<l>Plunged madly out of view</l>
<l>Down precipices steep</l>
<l>Into a chasm deep</l>
<l>Trench&#x00E8;d and torn</l>
<l>In the Earth's wounded side</l>
<l>By the phrenetic tide</l>
<l>When the white moon was born;</l>
<l>Till, lo, in creeks and bights and bays,</l>
<l>Clad in a shining rainbow haze,--</l>

<pb n="6  War: An Ode"/>

<l>A diapase</l>
<l>Of chrysoprase,</l>
<l>And lapis-lazuli,--</l>
<l>There dreamed and gleamed,</l>
<l>And played and swayed,</l>
<l>And surged and sang <hi rend="italic">the sea!</hi></l></lg></div>

<div id="macfie006" type="section" n="6">
<head>vi</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Thus was our planet wrought by arts of war,</l>
<l>By spear</l>
<l>Of Tyr,</l>
<l>By thunderbolt of Thor;</l>
<l>Thus did granitic isle and iron floe.</l>
<l>Welded and rivetted by hammer blow.</l>
<l>Assume the semblance of a solid Earth,—</l>
<l>Become a womb,</l>
<l>A cradle and a tomb.</l>
<l>Where wondrous things had burial and birth.</l>





<l>Vll</l>





<l>The lustral fires burned low.</l>

<l>The lurid glow</l>

<l>6</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Of the live lava dimmed and died away.</l>

<l>Only betimes an ember, burning slow,</l>

<l>Gleamed in the ashes grey,</l>

<l>Like an eye glazed and dull</l>

<l>In the worm-nibbled skull</l>

<l>Of some dead beast of prey</l>

<l>And softly round the ledges of the land</l>

<l>The surf went fumbling like a lover's hand</l>

<l>Feeling with wistful wonder</l>

<l>A living heart thereunder</l>

<l>That beat and throbbed athro' the silver sand;</l>

<l>Or kneading clay and lime</l>

<l>Into a tawny slime</l>

<l>That in the swaying motion of the tide</l>

<l>Quivered like some sea-monster's wrinkled hide.</l>

<l>viii</l>

<l>And, lo, upon the tawny briny mild</l>

<l>Flickered a smouldering bud—</l>

<l>A spark of green,—</l>

<l>A little speck, a tiny spore.</l>

<l>That on the vast savannahs of the shore</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Was hardly to be seen.</l>

<l>Not tinier the dust a zephyr blows</l>

<l>From the new-ripened anther of a rose;</l>

<l>Yet in its core</l>

<l>Were hidden more</l>

<l>Wisaom and love,</l>

<l>Beauty and grace.</l>

<l>Than all the suns and all the stars of space.</l>

<l>ix</l>
<l>Who in the store</l>

<l>Of helpless atoms huddled on the shore</l>
<l>Could have foreseen,</l>
<l>Fore-guessed, foretold</l>
<l>The vastitude of vernal green.</l>
<l>The granaries of autumn gold?—</l>
<l>Who in the voiceless atoms on the beach</l>
<l>Could have foreheard</l>
<l>The singing of a bird</l>

<l>The mighty harmonies of human speech?—</l>
<l>Could have foreknown</l>

<l>The living hands of flesh, and blood, and bone,</l>
<l>8</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>That from that little greenery would reach ?-</l>

<l>Who from the past</l>

<l>Could have forecast</l>

<l>The evolution of the future vast.</l>

<l>And guessed that in the tiny cell.</l>

<l>Were love, and hate, and heaven, and hell.</l>





<l>Silently was the work of life begun;</l>

<l>Upon the fairy anvil beat the sun;</l>

<l>Into the elfin furnace rushed the air</l>

<l>Forging shapes weak and strong, and foul and fair.</l>

<l>While unseen Death and unsurmised Love</l>

<l>Stood watching there</l>

<l>Ready to test and prove.</l>

<l>To kill and spare;</l>

<l>And by and by the green began to move</l>

<l>To breathe and feed, and swim and creep,</l>

<l>To sprawl across the sand, and voyage o'er the deep,</l>

<l>And by and by the sea grew white with swarms</l>

<l>Of flimsy forms.</l>

<l>9</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Bits of soft living slime.</l>

<l>Prisoned in shells of lime</l>

<l>Most delicately built.</l>

<l>Went swimming to and fro.</l>

<l>Or, dying, fell like snow.</l>

<l>Luting the ocean floor with oozy silt.</l>

<l>xi</l>

<l>And now on land life was no longer dumb:</l>

<l>Out of the ferns and moss, across the sky,</l>

<l>Insects with gauzy wings began to fly.</l>

<l>And buzz and hum,</l>

<l>And in the grass, crickets began to try</l>

<l>Their scrannel violins of wing and thigh;</l>

<l>Anon, in marshes like the bogs of St)rx</l>

<l>Uncanny things half bird, half bat.</l>

<l>And monstrous reptile shapes bloated or gaunt,—</l>

<l>Atlantosaur, and archaeopteryx.</l>

<l>And dinothere, and labyrinthodont.</l>

<l>And pterodactyl, monstrous things begat.</l>

<l>And evermore Death came, and laughed, and slew.</l>

<l>And patient Life and Birth bent to their task anew.</l>

<l>lO</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Xll</l>

<l>Death wrought with divers tools. Unwearied</l>

<l>Across the warp of life that wimpled red</l>

<l>The lightning flashed, shooting a livid thread</l>

<l>Like signatures of the undying dead—</l>

<l>Through the half-woven tapestries of doom;</l>

<l>And the mephitic breath and mordant fume</l>

<l>Of the hot-throated craters scorched and charred</l>

<l>The living lengthening web; and through the gloom</l>

<l>Some tempest howling shrill, and breathing hard</l>

<l>Frayed Life's unfinished fringes; and disease.</l>

<l>Nibbled the fairy fabric as the seas</l>

<l>Nibble their rocky headlands.   Yet, unmarred</l>

<l>Unscathed, unscarred.</l>

<l>Life ever wove in carpel and in womb</l>

<l>Imperishable webs of flesh and bloom.</l>

<l>xiii</l>

<l>Crumpled the cooling crust, and the deep ocean bed</l>

<l>Luted with lime and slime of creatures dead</l>

<l>—^That snow of death through the long aeons shed—</l>

<l>II</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Was puckered into marble mountain heights</l>
<l>—Himalayas and Alps, and Dolomites—</l>
<l>Where eagles had their eyries, and once more</l>
<l>Subsided and became the ocean floor;</l>
<l>And fire piled high sierras, and the rains</l>
<l>Wore them down inch by inch to desert plains;</l>
<l>And inch by inch the coral islands grew,</l>
<l>Like daisy garlands, in the ocean blue.</l>
<l>And inch by inch the glaciers ground away</l>
<l>The granite boulders into boulder-clay;</l>
<l>Yet never ceased the seethe of life, and still</l>
<l>Birth bore new forms faster than death could kill.</l>

<l>xiv</l>

<l>So the fierce aeons ran,</l>
<l>Till with exalted head</l>
<l>Throned upon the dead.</l>
<l>There stood immortal man-</l>
<l>Fruitage of all the tilth</l>
<l>And spilth</l>
<l>Of fire-</l>
<l>Following dreams and driven by desire.</l>

<l>12</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Through the gate of breath,</l>

<l>In the arms of Death,</l>

<l>By the path of Love, from the pit of shame,</l>

<l>With a fiery past.</l>

<l>And a future vast.</l>

<l>To the world he came.</l>

<l>XV</l>

<l>Spawn he was in the steamy mire.</l>

<l>Fins he was in a primal sea.</l>

<l>Wings he was in the feathered choir,</l>

<l>Or ever he came a man to be.</l>

<l>Of dead the mountain peaks are built,</l>

<l>Of dead the soil, of dead the silt—</l>

<l>The dead that led the way to him</l>

<l>Through shell and claw to brain and limb.</l>

<l>In every thought, in every part.</l>

<l>Made is he of a million slain,</l>

<l>Blood of the dead is in his heart,</l>

<l>Dreams of the dead are in his brain.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>XVI</l>





<l>Made at such infinite and fiery cost.</l>

<l>Wrought with such delicate and deadly art,</l>

<l>—Spirit and heart—</l>

<l>Out of things born, and buried, found and lost—</l>

<l>With all the energies of fire and frost</l>

<l>Of wind and flood</l>

<l>Of life and death</l>

<l>Tempestuous in his tidal blood</l>

<l>Combustive in his burning breath—</l>

<l>With unconsumed Eternity behind,</l>

<l>With unconceived Eternity before,</l>

<l>Man, the custodian of immortal mind.</l>

<l>Stood with bewildered senses at the door</l>

<l>Of darkling wisdom.   Round him still was blore</l>

<l>Of tempest and of furnace.   From the peak</l>

<l>The purple pennons of volcano-reek,</l>

<l>That the fire tossed and tore</l>

<l>Streamed in the sky an omen and ostent</l>

<l>Of bloody battle, and belligerent</l>

<l>He heard the salvos of the thunder speak</l>

<l>14</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>And crash</l>

<l>And roar.</l>

<l>He watched the lightning's white stiletto flash</l>

<l>And stab and gash</l>

<l>The bosom of the darkness as a fiend</l>

<l>Might stab a swarthy woman lying dead;</l>

<l>He saw the forest like a cornfield gleaned</l>

<l>By the white sickles of a surging flood;</l>

<l>And even the gorgeous sky of gold and red</l>

<l>Seemed a God's brazen byrny oozing blood.</l>

<l>Yea and he saw</l>

<l>How talon, tooth, and claw</l>

<l>Waged internecine combat, and he, too.</l>

<l>Seeing that life was war, went forth and slew.</l>

<l>xvii</l>
<l>Naked and weak.</l>

<l>He flaked a flint, and strung a hickory bow.</l>
<l>And struck a spark, and in a mountain gorge</l>
<l>Hammered a spear, upon a granite forge</l>
<l>With cunning blow.</l>
<l>And spoored the mammoth o'er the prairie bleak,</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>And faced and fought it to its overthrow;</l>
<l>And stabbed the bear upon the glacial peak,</l>
<l>And clubbed the walrus on the drifting floe,</l>
<l>Till the warm blood ran crimson to the creek,</l>
<l>Steaming upon the snow.</l>

<l>xviii</l>

<l>No fear could blear his sight, no woe could blanch</l>
<l>His vivid blood.  The glacial avalanche</l>
<l>Like a white Juggernaut rode down the land</l>
<l>Trampling the forests with a madman's lust,</l>
<l>Braying the iron-hearted rocks to dust.</l>
<l>And drift, and sand.</l>

<l>And famine, and fatigue, and cold, and pain</l>
<l>Cramped his fierce heart and froze his fervid breath</l>
<l>Yet still he conquered.   At his feet in death</l>
<l>Writhed monsters could have crunched him 'tween</l>

<l>their teeth</l>
<l>Like a ripe berry, or a cob of grain,</l>
<l>But there he stood with all the world beneath,</l>
<l>A pigmy creature with a giant brain.</l>
<l>i6</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>XIX</l>

<l>Yet came no peace.   Still in his heart was strife;</l>

<l>A far fore-seeing Fate</l>

<l>Using his pride and Hate,</l>

<l>Wrought at the web of life;</l>

<l>And driven still</l>

<l>By his own passionate will</l>

<l>Upon a bloody way.</l>

<l>He seized his sword his brother man to slay.</l>

<l>Nation slew nation: horde abolished horde.</l>

<l>Vengeance and famine swept whole tribes away,</l>

<l>And still there sped the spear and flashed the sword,</l>

<l>Carving the human clay;</l>

<l>And still life came of death, and joy of pain.</l>

<l>And still, as Man his fellow-mortals slew,</l>

<l>Like a red rose, watered with bloody rain,</l>

<l>The human spirit grew,—</l>

<l>Grew in the depth and height of its desire.</l>

<l>Grew as the Earth had grown amid the fire.</l>





<l>17</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>PART II</l>





<l>What Chalybes</l>

<l>Are these?</l>

<l>A million fires, a million furnaces</l>

<l>Flicker and flare.</l>

<l>The maw of Earth disgorges</l>

<l>Fuel for mighty forges;</l>

<l>Antediluvian trees</l>

<l>From Carboniferous bogs</l>

<l>Sublimed to fiery fogs,</l>

<l>Pollute the golden air.</l>

<l>The flames upleap and flash.</l>

<l>The hammers swing and crash.</l>

<l>What Chalybes</l>

<l>Are these?</l>

<l>What are they forging there?</l>

<l>i8</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>n</l>

<l>The fiery chimneys belch Fear's mordant breath.</l>

<l>The noisy forges beat the tune of Death.</l>

<l>Hate swings his hammer on the trenchant steel.</l>

<l>Untiringly with bony bloody heel,</l>

<l>Death works the bellows: at macabre looms.</l>

<l>Despair and Wrath are weaving tragic dooms;</l>

<l>And all men's art.</l>

<l>Wisdom and skill.</l>

<l>Courage of heart.</l>

<l>And force of will.</l>

<l>Their love of good, their faith in God,</l>

<l>Their power to crave, and to abhor,</l>

<l>Are grown to crank and piston-rod.</l>

<l>In the grim red machine of war.</l>

<l>iii</l>

<l>Like belt, and wheel, and blade and shaft,</l>
<l>They ply a dull mechanic craft;</l>
<l>Their hearts beat in the hammer blow.</l>
<l>And with the roaring furnace draught</l>

<l>Their breathings and their sighings go.</l>
<l>Outside are wings and summer winds.</l>
<l>And sunlight dancing on the sea,</l>
<l>And woods, and hills, but they are blind</l>
<l>With hate and fear, and cannot see.</l>
<l>Outside is singing and a thrush</l>
<l>Calls through the lilac to its mate;</l>
<l>They only hear the roar and rush</l>
<l>Of the insensate wheels of Fate.</l>
<l>With bodies weary, souls outworn,</l>
<l>They watch the wondrous years go by.</l>
<l>Toiling that Freedom may be born.</l>
<l>Turned into dead machines they die.</l>

<l>To slaughter and redeem</l>
<l>The world.</l>

<l>These are the fierce primaeval fires,</l>

<l>His furnace flame. His breaker-surge.</l>
<l>His graving tool, His pruning knife, His punitory</l>

<l>scourge I</l>

<l>Great slogans drive them forth, great battle-cries—</l>

<l>"Liberty," "Fatherland!"   The bounding blood</l>

<l>In their own fearless hearts is as the flow</l>

<l>Of an insurgent flood, and in their eyes</l>

<l>The wild auroral lights of battle glow.</l>

<l>The gentle, low,</l>

<l>Flutter the broidered banners of the Morn.</l>

<l>As in a dream I watch them go.</l>
<l>From Seine to Aisne,</l>
<l>From Mons to Meaux;</l>

<l>Of poison-gas, and shot, and shell.</l>
<l>At Vimy Ridge, and La Boiselle,</l>

<l>The festering corruption of the slain.</l>

<l>Body and soul seem impotent and vain.</l>

<l>There in a bloody pool</l>

<l>A carrion crow pecks at a bloated horse;</l>

<l>And some poor fool.</l>

<l>Sniped like a frightened rabbit in the gorse.</l>

<l>Has left on No-man's Land his huddled corse;</l>

<l>Where are the flaming hope, the fiery cross</l>

<l>While poisonous and thick.</l>

<l>Out of strange Stygian glooms.</l>

<l>Wreath after yellow wreath,</l>

<l>And crush and mutilate with cloven heel</l>

<l>The fallen and the dying, till the mud</l>

<l>Of mangled mortals.   On the sea afloat</l>

<l>Great Boats of Battle cleave the waves asunder.</l>

<l>Keel after keel.</l>

<l>Things of the spirit, things of the mind, these are the</l>

<l>things at stake.</l>
<l>Not bodies only but faiths and creeds the bomb and the</l>

<l>Not mortals only but mortal sins the fire and the shrap¬</l>

<l>And aspirations, ideals, hopes perish and pass away.</l>

<l>Foolish may be our war-desires, blundering, blind our</l>

<l>aims</l>
<l>But still the shoddy and sham of life are burned in the</l>

<l>battle flames.</l>
<l>By tempest, by fire, by talons and teeth, by war, and dis¬</l>
<l>ease and lust</l>
<l>The hand of Death and the hand of Life have wrought</l>

<l>at our wondrous dust</l>
<l>But ever above, the hand of Love our destiny controls</l>
<l>Moulding to beauty and to truth our bodies and our</l>

<l>souls.</l>





<l>But why should we destroy</l>

<l>A body like a temple full of joy</l>

<l>A temple yea, a Hecatompuloi,</l>

<l>With golden gates</l>

<l>Mighty and broad,</l>

<l>Made not for little Fears and Hates,</l>

<l>But for the fiery Chariots of God.</l>

<l>Why must we slay? We know not why.</l>

<l>With holy pleas we go to kill;</l>

<l>With noble aims we go to die;</l>
<l>But ever still,</l>

<l>Behind our dreams, behind our will.</l>
<l>There work inevitable Fates</l>
<l>Whose far desires our swords fulfil.</l>
<l>We know not why!</l>
<l>Our words are vain!</l>
<l>No gleaming words can glorify</l>
<l>So much of sin so much of pain.</l>
<l>But we are driven by the Soul</l>
<l>That with his Beauty maketh whole</l>
<l>Even the wounded and the slain.</l>

<l>Vlll</l>





<l>O seismic souls of men, the shaken world</l>
<l>Won peace and beauty after wild turmoil.</l>
<l>The flowers their silken bannerets unfurled,</l>
<l>The meadows comforted the tortured soil;</l>
<l>And now while still the craters trickle blood.</l>
<l>While still the ground is scourged by fiery rains.</l>
<l>The cornflowers and the poppies burst in bud</l>
<l>From the warm ichor of Life's genial veins;</l>
<l>And in the ulcerous gashes of the shells</l>
<l>In foetid hells.</l>

<l>In leprous thickets full of death and shame.</l>
<l>Twinkle the starwort, and the pimpernels,</l>
<l>And gorse, and charlock, and laburnum flame;</l>
<l>And while the raucous cannon belch and roar.</l>
<l>In sudden silences amid the thunder</l>
<l>We hear the skylarks singing as they soar</l>
<l>48</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Of beauty and of wonder;</l>
<l>And in the trenches, cheek by jowl with Death,</l>
<l>(O heart of Youth indomitably strong!)</l>
<l>We hear the muddy boys with merry breath</l>
<l>Chorus a mirthful song.</l>

<l>ix</l>

<l>And all these cataclysms of the soul</l>

<l>Will end in light, and harmony, and peace :</l>

<l>The battle-thunder will no longer roll.</l>

<l>The roar of guns will cease.</l>

<l>Only the embattled legions of the mind</l>

<l>Spirit with spirit will in love contend</l>

<l>To comprehend</l>

<l>The Soul behind</l>

<l>Beauty and Power—</l>

<l>The Love that sighs in every wind</l>

<l>And buds in every flower.</l>





<l>Time is so brief, Eternity so long,</l>
<l>Life is so low. Infinity so high,</l>

<l>49</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Our bodies are so weak, and Death so strong,</l>
<l>So soon we wither and so soon we die.</l>
<l>That only things of spirit will endure</l>
<l>And love itself only of Love is sure.</l>
<l>Yet if we clutch the Eternity in Time</l>
<l>The Infinity that lurks in finite things—</l>
<l>If still we soar and still we climb</l>
<l>With wounded feet and weary wings</l>
<l>Still higher in the realm of thought—</l>
<l>If we have agonized and fought</l>
<l>For Truth and Beauty day by day</l>
<l>The little things that we have wrought</l>
<l>Will never fade and die away</l>
<l>But grow and spread</l>
<l>As from the dead</l>
<l>Evolved our bodies' magic clay.</l>

<l>O, brave the banners flowing</l>
<l>Inscribed with holy names,</l>

<l>And bravely men have striven</l>
<l>For this or that high prize</l>
<l>Yet they are drawn and driven</l>
<l>To ends they have not wrought for</l>
<l>To good they have not sought for</l>
<l>To goals they have not fought for.</l>
<l>By Love that never dies—</l>
<l>By the same Love impassioned</l>
<l>That filled the Earth with fire,</l>
<l>And fiercely finely fashioned</l>
<l>In Beauty its Desire—</l>
<l>By the same Love whose sighing</l>
<l>Is Pity's gentle breath</l>
<l>By the same Love who dying</l>
<l>Conquered Death.</l>

<l>Xll</l>

<l>Not conquests of great cities</l>
<l>Not mastery of great seas</l>

<l>Yea little loves and pities</l>
<l>And children on their knees—</l>
<l>Fair children to inherit</l>
<l>New soarings of the soul.</l>
<l>New faculties of spirit.</l>
<l>As centuries unroll,—</l>
<l>Not arrogant ambitions</l>
<l>For Empire rich and broad.</l>
<l>But ever brighter Visions</l>
<l>Of the wise heart of God.</l>

<l>From every crater bloody</l>
<l>Will bloom a kindly thought;</l>
<l>From every tortured body</l>
<l>Some beauty will be wrought.</l>
<l>Love will again awaken.</l>
<l>Truth will regain her crown;</l>
<l>Men's seismic souls have shaken</l>
<l>A million Dagons down.</l>

<l>A Quatercentenary Ode*</l>

<l>Eternity is throned upon thy spires:</l>

<l>Upon Eternity thy towers rest:</l>

<l>Thou wert conceived in the eternal fires</l>

<l>Of the sun's womb: upon the sun's white breast</l>

<l>Wert carried ere the souls of men were made—</l>

<l>Nay, in the nebula the seed was sown</l>

<l>Of every stone.</l>

<l>And by the stars were thy foundations laid.</l>

<l>The fire-mist held thee ere the sun it bore;</l>

<l>The sun had presage of thee ere she hurled</l>

<l>From her wild heart the world;</l>

<l>And the hot world enwrapped thee at its core,</l>

<l>In lava and in lightning, to await</l>

<l>The slow, fastidious finishing of Fate.</l>

<l>Then the round earth grew furrowed and grew frore,</l>

<l>And the encircling steam,</l>

<l>Condensing in a stream,</l>

<l>Hissed, boiling, bubbling on a barren shore.</l>

<l>Till the Word spake, and then</l>

<l>There blossomed flowers, and beasts, and souls of men;</l>

<l>And lo, in man's magnificent desires</l>

<l>And high imaginations, wilful, warm,</l>

<l>Thy polished pinnacles, and frosty spires,</l>

<l>Took shape and form.</l>

<l>Till all this growth of granite towers.</l>

<l>And pediments and columns round.</l>

<l>Like spikelets of colossal flowers,</l>

<l>Came burning through the ground.</l>

<l>Eternity was author of thy plan;</l>

<l>The fire-mist, and the sun, and earth, and man</l>

<l>Joined in thy making.   Yea, by fire and thought</l>

<l>The gracious granite miracle was wrought.</l>

<l>And now thou art full-grown,</l>

<l>Full-leaved, full-blown—</l>

<l>A torch that flares across the night</l>

<l>A peak where wisdom may be set on high.</l>

<l>Under a cloudless sky,</l>

<l>In Alpine air.</l>

<l>Yet what of Truth and Wisdom can we share,—</l>

<l>We who have seen Eternities prepare</l>

<l>"The polisht stones and squair,"</l>

<l>We who have watched worlds blossom and worlds die,</l>

<l>How can we guess at things so far away?</l>

<l>How read the Mind who shapes the feathery snows</l>

<l>Then knits a glacier to knead the clay</l>

<l>That makes a rose.</l>

<l>Who sends the cataracts with heavy feet.</l>

<l>And white tumultuous toil,</l>

<l>Our spirits are His trowel and His hod.</l>

<l>We lay a stone: He labours at a soul.</l>

<l>How can we see with His all-seeing sight</l>

<l>Issues so broad,</l>

<l>Meanings so infinite?</l>

<l>How can we know?   How can we understand?</l>

<l>Who build a house of Truth upon the sand</l>

<l>Knowing the corner stone to be a lie,</l>

<l>Knowing the roof</l>

<l>On finite facts by infinity effaced,</l>

<l>How can we know whose knowledge is so small?</l>

<l>Why should we know?  Why should we live at all?</l>

<l>Why all this toil and strife?</l>

<l>How did the Chaos burgeon into life?</l>

<l>Did it imagine, when the toil begun,</l>

<l>'Twould blossom into star, and moon, and sun</l>

<l>Rolling to rhythmic music?   Toil seemed vain.</l>

<l>Mistily, vaguely, dizzily it spun</l>

<l>Racked with strange pain.</l>

<l>In fiery rain.</l>

<l>Through black abysses, while the cosmic power</l>

<l>Compelled it into bird, and beast, and flower,</l>

<l>And this grey temple's pinnacle and tower.</l>

<l>Truth is eternities away,</l>
<l>And we but climb.</l>

<l>To the dawn of day.</l>

<l>What if the truth we do not see?</l>

<l>What matters truth.</l>

<l>To love and youth.</l>

<l>Who labour for eternity?</l>

<l>What if an error or a flaw</l>

<l>Life's beauty mars?</l>

<l>We are hammered to eternal law.</l>

<l>On love's high stithy by the stars.</l>

<l>The hands that made these spires were held</l>

<l>By the strong hand that holds the seas.</l>

<l>And every pillar was compelled,</l>

<l>By mighty cosmic energies.</l>

<l>And what we have not rightly wrought</l>

<l>In stone or thought</l>

<l>Will not endure; yet even so</l>

<l>Out of the false the true will grow.</l>

<l>And in this temple by the Northern Sea</l>

<l>Continually</l>

<l>Will surge and seethe the fire-mist of the mind</l>

<l>Fettered and free.</l>

<l>Radiant and blind—</l>

<l>Will bud and blossom nebulae of soul.</l>

<l>City of granite tower and granite spire.</l>
<l>Of grim, indomitable granite will.</l>
<l>Deep in your granite heart the cosmic fire</l>
<l>Is burning still,</l>

<l>Building immortal mountains for the world,</l>
<l>New Sinais and new Pisgahs; and unfurled—</l>
<l>Magnificently whirled</l>
<l>By tempests of your pity, and your ire</l>
<l>Like leaping flame athwart the heavens blown-</l>
<l>I see the banners of your fierce desire</l>
<l>To set white Freedom on a lofty throne,</l>
<l>Made as of granite stone.</l>
<l>And as by surges of your Northern Sea,</l>
<l>Girt by your souls and swords impregnably;</l>
<l>And gleaming bright.</l>
<l>Crimson and white</l>
<l>76</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Like surf that breaks upon your granite coasts.</l>

<l>Tinged by a sunrise red,</l>

<l>I see great hosts</l>

<l>Of men and ghosts—</l>

<l>The armies of your living and your dead.</l>

<l>I hear the rhythmic pulsing ocean tread</l>

<l>Of thousands of triumphant marching feet;</l>

<l>I hear the thundering, tremendous beat</l>

<l>Of thousands of heroic hearts whose blood</l>

<l>Rolls like a crimson flood.</l>

<l>Drawn by a splendid dream.</l>

<l>Injustice to avenge, dishonour to redeem.</l>

<l>ii</l>

<l>From Ben Muick Dhui gaunt anu grey.</l>

<l>From granite cairns of Lochnagar,</l>

<l>From Buchan Ness</l>

<l>And Dyce and Dess,</l>

<l>From Cruden Bay</l>

<l>And Craigievar,</l>

<l>From moors of Dinnet and Braemar,</l>

<l>From banks of Dee and banks of Don,</l>

<l>77</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>From Callater and Loch Kinord,</l>
<l>O'er purple heath and thymy sward,</l>
<l>A surging sea of soul and sword,</l>
<l>I see them flowing, flaming on.</l>

<l>iii</l>

<l>Boys of the moor, and of the field,</l>

<l>Boys of the office, and the plough,</l>

<l>From castle, college, manse, and bield.</l>

<l>With hero's heart and dreamer's brow,</l>

<l>I see them marching, marching now.</l>

<l>I see them by the crumbling crown</l>

<l>Of "Kings," and where the granite spires</l>

<l>Of "Marischal" soar like altar fires</l>

<l>Above the traffic of the town.</l>

<l>In leafy lane and stony street.</l>

<l>Their white and crimson surge I meet,</l>

<l>A torrent flowing, flowing down</l>

<l>To the rhythmic fall of marching feet.</l>

<l>IV</l>

<l>I who have felt the North-Sea brine</l>

<l>Upon my lips, whose eyes have seen</l>

<l>The sunlight and the moonlight shine</l>

<l>On the white streets of Aberdeen—</l>

<l>I who have walked in scarlet gown</l>

<l>Beneath the crumbling granite crown.</l>

<l>Who still in fancy and in dreams</l>

<l>Climb Lochnagar</l>

<l>And hear afar</l>

<l>The music of its mountain streams,</l>

<l>Whose heart is still</l>

<l>In every rill.</l>

<l>Whose hopes wade knee-deep in the heather—</l>

<l>Surely I know</l>

<l>Where these boys go.</l>

<l>My soul and theirs must go together,</l>

<l>That mine their blood and mine their breath.</l>

<l>Their fame, their shame, their life, their death.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Eugeny</l>

<l>"Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect. In thy</l>
<l>book all my members were written, which in continuance were</l>
<l>fashioned, when as yet there were none of them."</l>

<l>By what unseen and subtile bands</l>
<l>Were you two lovers bound and wed?</l>
<l>By tiny unborn baby-hands</l>
<l>Your spirits were together led.</l>

<l>Your meeting passions, seeming-blind</l>
<l>Were in Life's prescient control;</l>
<l>You looked—there was conceived a mind;</l>
<l>You smiled—there was conceived a soul;</l>

<l>You kissed—and in the country dim</l>
<l>That lies beyond the bounds of space.</l>
<l>Foreshadowed was a baby's limb,</l>
<l>Prefigured was a baby's face.</l>





<l>80</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>This was your love's supernal source,</l>
<l>And this its mystic mundane goal,—</l>
<l>The grip of the creative Force</l>
<l>That needs a body for a soul.</l>

<l>O wondrous is the eugeny.</l>
<l>That finds a soul its avatar;</l>
<l>God's baby-dream you could not see</l>
<l>Drew you together from afar;</l>

<l>And if perchance you lovers twain</l>
<l>Had been by Fate asunder torn.</l>
<l>Then had God's baby-dream been vain,</l>
<l>A baby soul had died unborn.</l>

<l>In Memory of</l>

<l>Major William La Touche Congreve, V.C.</l>





<l>" The best always befalls the best."</l>

<l>—Quotation from letter of his tutor at Eton.</l>





<l>Only the best can e'er the best befall,</l>
<l>Unto the best, the worst must best reveal;</l>
<l>And though he felt the rent Earth rock and reel.</l>
<l>And through the loathly yellow poison-pall</l>
<l>Heard thunder to reboant thunder call.</l>
<l>And glimpsed the flickering of bloody steel.</l>
<l>Yet Faith he had to know that wounds may heal.</l>
<l>And Love he had that could transfigure all.</l>
<l>To his own Spirit's Beauty.   So his sword.</l>
<l>Put to such terrible and poignant test</l>
<l>In slaughterous tasks his human heart abhorred,</l>
<l>Seemed in his eyes God's Justice manifest.</l>
<l>And of all glorious fates, the fate seemed best</l>
<l>To die for Freedom, England, and his Lord.</l>

<l>Death, the Child</l>

<l>The tender limbs, and the slender grace.</l>

<l>Death of the dimpled hands, death of the rosy cheek.</l>
<l>Wilt give us all we have lost, and all that we vainly</l>

<l>seek.</l>
<l>Seeds of unripened hopes thy fingers hold.</l>
<l>Wilt quicken the dead.</l>
<l>To white and red.</l>
<l>And green and gold,</l>

<l>And flickering passion will flame, and faded promise</l>

<l>Rest, and Sleep, and Dreams,</l>
<l>And a Garden drenched with dew;</l>
<l>Till Life in verity seems</l>
<l>But a mist that thy Smile comes through.</l>

<l>Once I gazed on Death, and he looked in my face and</l>

<l>Wedding Ode</l>

<l>To A Poetess</l>





<l>Like swans on an enchanted lake</l>
<l>Your dreamy days have drifted by;</l>
<l>Now, lovely, dreamy Lady wake,</l>
<l>A Glory lightens in the sky!</l>
<l>The empyrean dome above</l>
<l>Is burning, blinding sapphire blue;</l>
<l>Your misty morning dream of love</l>
<l>Is now a dream come true.</l>

<l>ii</l>

<l>We two have wandered hand in hand</l>
<l>In merry moonlit fairyland;</l>
<l>We two have culled Parnassus thyme</l>
<l>Above the clouds on peaks sublime;</l>

<l>93</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>But far more bright</l>

<l>Than fairy-light</l>

<l>This love that dawns upon your eyes.</l>

<l>And higher than Parnassus height</l>

<l>The summit of your Paradise.</l>

<l>No dream is this—this orb of fire.</l>

<l>This splendid peak of white Desire.</l>

<l>iii</l>

<l>Your dream of Love takes human form.</l>
<l>And human heart, and human speech.</l>
<l>And runs to you, alive and warm.</l>
<l>With hands your living hands can reach;</l>
<l>And every other dream grows dim.</l>
<l>He hath such light and life in him.</l>

<l>IV</l>

<l>Yet mid the glory flicker gleams</l>
<l>Of other dreams</l>
<l>Of olden days;</l>
<l>And misty things</l>

<l>94</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>With rainbow wings</l>
<l>Still dance adown your sunlit ways;</l>
<l>Love's living heart, so warm and deep,</l>
<l>A million million dreams can keep.</l>
<l>And all fair dreams you ever knew</l>
<l>Still from Love's eyes may smile to you.</l>





<l>O be a poet-dreamer still,</l>

<l>With heart and will</l>

<l>Athrob, athrill,</l>

<l>iEolian harps in Beauty's breath.</l>

<l>Until at last God's Love fulfil</l>

<l>All dreams of Life in the dream of Death,</l>

<l>Still dream; still let thy spirit change,</l>

<l>Like light and shadow on the sea!</l>

<l>Still keep existence fresh and strange</l>

<l>With Wonder and with Mystery.</l>

<l>Mother of the Land,</l>

<l>Around thy throne the hearts of England stand</l>
<l>Waiting thy will.   And since thou art our Queen,</l>
<l>And since thy life has moved in lovely ways.</l>
<l>The granite loyalty of Aberdeen</l>
<l>Greets thee with love and reverence and praise;</l>
<l>And boasts that these great battlements of stone</l>
<l>Are buttresses and bulwarks of thy throne.</l>
<l>For thou art wise, and they are Wisdom's fort;</l>
<l>And thou art true, and they are Truth's domain;</l>
<l>And thou art kind, and they are Healing's Court,</l>
<l>Where Love and Pity reign:</l>

<l>Thou art the symbol of all things we seek, too lofty to</l>

<l>attain.</l>

<l>Welcome, thrice welcome to our granite town.</l>
<l>Thou who hast made the burden of a crown</l>
<l>Burn like a halo, kindle like a star—</l>
<l>Welcome, thrice Welcome!   In the days afar</l>
<l>The Queen who joined the Thistle and the Rose,</l>
<l>Making firm friends of foes.</l>
<l>And Mary Queen of Scots, and Her of Guise</l>
<l>Rode down these streets, under admiring eyes.</l>
<l>But never Queen so fair and loved as thou</l>
<l>Who comest to join in our rejoicings now.</l>

<l>"Welcome, thrice welcome, Queen most fair and kind!</l>
<l>Welcome, thrice welcome!" sighs the autumn wind.</l>
<l>"Welcome, thrice welcome!" chants the Northern Sea.</l>
<l>And both come singing from thy home to thee—</l>
<l>We are one in sea and wind as one in heart.</l>
<l>And thou at once our Queen and kindred art;</l>
<l>Welcome, thrice welcome to our Aberdeen!</l>

<l>In Memory of a Young Airman</l>

<l>Brown hair, brown brow, brown throat, like bronze</l>

<l>Sculptured by a Praxiteles,</l>
<l>And hazel eyes, like summer dawns.</l>

<l>Lighting the isles of Southern seas.</l>

<l>He seemed like some great poet's dream</l>
<l>-Of some white lovely Grecian god—</l>

<l>Adonis, with young eyes agleam;</l>
<l>Or Herakles, with shoulders broad.</l>

<l>Or Hermes, with his winged feet</l>

<l>Flying on messages divine;</l>
<l>Or Ganymede, the stripling sweet,</l>

<l>Pouring the gods their ruby wine;</l>

<l>Or Hyacinthus, ere the wound</l>
<l>Turned him to flowers in Zephir's arms;</l>

<l>Or tall Narcissus, ere he swooned</l>

<l>From love of his own mirrored charms.</l>





<l>103</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>Yet, though his beauty and his grace</l>
<l>Were as the dreams of Grecian art,</l>

<l>'Twas England's soul illumed his face,</l>
<l>'Twas England blossomed in his heart.</l>

<l>And England, England, England lit</l>
<l>His eyes with loving, filial joy;</l>

<l>He went and gave his life for it.</l>
<l>This happy-hearted English boy.</l>

<l>And gave it not as one might lay</l>

<l>A gift upon an altar high;</l>
<l>He did not kneel, he did not pray;</l>

<l>Gaily he sallied forth to die.</l>

<l>He had nor gods, nor marble fanes.</l>
<l>He had no pious faith forsooth.</l>

<l>Save English lawns, and English lanes,</l>
<l>And English homes, and English truth.</l>

<l>England, his Merrie England, stood</l>

<l>For all things high, and all things free;</l>
<l>104</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>For all things wise, and all things good;</l>
<l>For Justice and for Liberty.</l>

<l>So he faced peril with a jest.</l>

<l>And with a smile he paid the price.</l>
<l>England was worthy England's best,</l>

<l>England was worth all sacrifice.</l>

<l>There was such laughter in his breath,</l>

<l>-He was so young, and strong, and straight.</l>
<l>His beauty made a mock of death</l>
<l>His joyance had no place for hate.</l>

<l>He went as warrior of the air.</l>

<l>Above him were the sun and stars.</l>
<l>And rosy clouds, and under there</l>

<l>The trenches' livid weals and scars;</l>

<l>The bloody fangs of barbed wire.</l>

<l>The muddy craters choked with dead.</l>
<l>The cannon belching smoke and fire.</l>

<l>The crests of battle breaking red.</l>

<l>IDS</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>He saw the glint of steel below.</l>
<l>The thunder of the guns he heard;</l>

<l>But what to him were death and woe!</l>
<l>He only was a boy, a bird—</l>

<l>A boy on high adventure bent.</l>

<l>An eagle soaring to the blue;</l>
<l>Up to the radiant sun he went,</l>

<l>Through the bright fields of air he flew.</l>

<l>He loosed his bolt.   The bright death sped</l>
<l>Spinning like an Ithuriel's spear,</l>

<l>Earth spluttered red around the dead,</l>
<l>Yet felt he neither wrath nor fear.</l>

<l>For he was messenger of Fate,</l>
<l>Merely a boy, a bird, a Doom,</l>

<l>And neither doubt, nor fear, nor hate</l>
<l>Within his boyish heart had room.</l>

<l>There came a blizzard through the skies,</l>

<l>A shrieking gust of shrapnel rain;</l>
<l>io6</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>A blinding mist came o'er his eyes,</l>
<l>He felt a sudden throb of pain;</l>

<l>Then peace.   With broken wings he lay</l>
<l>Upon the ground.   But still meseems</l>

<l>The climbing spirit cleaves its way.</l>
<l>With the white wings of happy dreams.</l>

<l>And still meseems the boundless force,</l>
<l>The beauty and the love set free</l>

<l>From the gross flesh, will run its course</l>
<l>Through aeons of Eternity;—</l>

<l>Unspoilt, unspent, will reach its aim.</l>
<l>And from the dead will spring perchance</l>

<l>A Europe purged by steel and flame—</l>
<l>A nobler England, nobler France.</l>

<l>Yea, from his fame as white as snow,</l>

<l>And from his sacrificial blood,</l>
<l>The lilies of new France will grow</l>

<l>The roses of new England bud.</l>

<l>I had forgot.</l>

<l>But Love did not forget to keep</l>
<l>What Love had wrought;</l>
<l>And when you spake,—</l>
<l>Wan, half-awake.</l>
<l>Dim as a daylight flame.</l>
<l>Up from my Memory's oubliette, the old Dream softly</l>

<l>came.</l>

<l>I cried, "O shrunken form!</l>

<l>O wrinkled mummy face!</l>

<l>Once thou wert rosy-warm.</l>

<l>Go back and dream in thy cold dwelling-place.</l>
<l>Go back and sleep,</l>
<l>Down in thy dungeon deep!</l>

<l>Sheeted in shame.</l>

<l>With chin-clothes of despair.</l>

<l>Shambling along it came.</l>

<l>All tottering and lame.</l>

<l>Up to the upper air;</l>

<l>And, as a soul that perishes with drouth</l>

<l>Might stoop to drink</l>

<l>At a fountain's brink</l>

<l>With famished mouth.</l>

<l>So knelt and drank it of your beauty there.</l>

<l>—O wonder!—as it gazed it grew</l>

<l>Like a faint rose refreshed with dew</l>

<l>Most sweet and fresh,</l>

<l>Spirit and flesh,</l>

<l>With leaping heart, and eyes of blue;</l>

<l>And in its mouth, and brow, and hair,</l>

<l>Your mouth, and brow, and hair, I knew;</l>

<l>And suddenly I was aware</l>

<l>That ye were one, not two:</l>

<l>You were the Dream of all things fair.</l>

<l>You were my Dream, my Dream was you;</l>

<l>The Blue Bird</l>

<l>Symbol of Happiness</l>

<l>In verdant woods, and azure skies.</l>

<l>On purple peaks of Paradise,</l>

<l>In golden gardens of a star;</l>

<l>But in your eyes</l>

<l>It flits, and flies.</l>

<l>And in your heart its nestings are—</l>

<l>So near, so far.</l>

<l>Like a wild lark that longs for space.</l>

<l>It beats and beats against the blue</l>

<l>Of your bright eyes, then flutters through</l>

<l>Your eyelids, and lights up your face,</l>

<l>To J. F. White (Art Critic) When Dying</l>

<l>Since thou hast beauty all life long,</l>

<l>In sun and shade,</l>

<l>Followed, and worshipped, and obeyed.</l>

<l>Beauty will make thy spirit strong</l>

<l>And unafraid.</l>

<l>Beauty will glorify the gloom.</l>

<l>Beauty will show the unborn light</l>

<l>Leaping within the laden womb</l>

<l>Of weary night.</l>

<l>Beauty will make the silence song,</l>

<l>Beauty will make the darkness bright</l>

<l>Hast thou not heard the loving Heart</l>
<l>Whose music passes Music's art?</l>
<l>Hast thou not seen a white Hand flit</l>
<l>Across the darkness, lighting it?</l>
<l>Peace surely waits beyond the pain,</l>

<l>112</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>And calm beyond the troubled bar;</l>
<l>We must believe that death is good.</l>
<l>We blossoms of a dying star.</l>
<l>And surely He is kind and wise.</l>
<l>Who made such Beauty for thine eyes.</l>

<l>We watched thee sow, we watched thee reap</l>
<l>Wisdom and Honour day by day.</l>
<l>And now when comes white-lidded Sleep</l>
<l>To lead thee down the Lonely Way,</l>
<l>We will not sigh, we will not weep.</l>
<l>For Beauty's thoughts are wise and deep.</l>

<l>What though the night be dark and dumb?</l>

<l>Out of the night</l>

<l>Will issue light.</l>

<l>And song will from the silence come.</l>

<l>So lie at rest</l>

<l>On Beauty's breast.</l>

<l>Who maketh Beauty knoweth best.</l>

<l>Pan's Flute</l>

<l>My heart's whole love in thy white hand I lay.</l>
<l>Irrevocably as befits the deed,</l>
<l>Undoubtingly, for surely Love decreed</l>
<l>Complete surrender, and I must obey.</l>
<l>Sweet Lady, do not throw the love away;</l>
<l>There may be roses in a wrinkled seed.</l>
<l>And Pan drew music from a broken reed</l>
<l>Till all the world danced round to hear him play.</l>

<l>Imprisoned in my passion's thorny fruit</l>

<l>A million crimson roses crumpled lie;</l>

<l>And though my melancholy heart be mute,</l>

<l>Touch it and lyric voices will reply.</l>

<l>Make of the hollow reed a magic lute,</l>

<l>To tremble with thy breath, and sing, and sigh.</l>

<l>The "Titanic"</l>

<l>(An Ode of Immortality)</l>





<l>O, ribbed and riveted with iron and steel,</l>
<l>Cuirassed and byrnied, breathing smoke and flame.</l>
<l>Cleaving the billows with her monstrous keel,</l>
<l>A Titan challenging the gods she came!</l>
<l>The surf piled lilies round her eager prow,</l>
<l>The wind made music through her mighty spars.</l>
<l>Her hot heart thudded, thundered, and her brow</l>
<l>Had converse with the stars.</l>

<l>ii</l>

<l>What phantoms of what famous ships of old</l>

<l>Came to convoy</l>

<l>Her freight of joy.</l>

<l>Her beauty, and her splendour, o'er the main!</l>

<l>Here rocked the weather-beaten barques of Troy</l>
<l>Beside the ghostly galleons of Spain;</l>
<l>And there the Argo, with her fleece of gold,</l>
<l>Followed the Mayflower with her pilgrims bold;</l>
<l>And yonder, with her motley tattered crew,</l>
<l>Santa Maria o'er the surges flew</l>
<l>On buoyant wing</l>

<l>While Viking warriors, with eyes of blue,</l>
<l>Lay on their oars and wondered at the Thing,—</l>
<l>At the prodigious panoply of steel,</l>
<l>The pounding rods, the whirling blades, the invulner¬</l>
<l>able keel,</l>

<l>Natheless, old Charon, paddling in his boat.</l>
<l>Smiled, and the laughter rattled in his throat.</l>

<l>iii</l>

<l>Why does Death's laughter jangle in the dark?</l>
<l>What can he do against so brave a barque?</l>
<l>Louder than any laughter is her speech:</l>
<l>Ten thousand miles her utterance can reach:</l>

<l>ii6</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>And like ten thousand Argus eyes agaze</l>
<l>Her mast lights glimmer and her portholes blaze.</l>
<l>So mightily her turbines whirl and whir,</l>
<l>Great cables she can snap like gossamer,</l>
<l>And tempests move her, but as breathings stir</l>
<l>The branches of a forest.   Who would seek</l>
<l>To grapple with the giant strength of her</l>
<l>Must have for battle-axe a mountain spur.</l>
<l>Must have a poniard like a mountain peak.</l>

<l>iv</l>

<l>Yea, but an icy mountain is unloosed:</l>
<l>Riding the sea, it cometh to the joust.</l>
<l>Reckless and ruthless, arrogant and proud.</l>
<l>Clad in white armour, visored with a cloud.</l>
<l>No bugles blow, no trumpets blare.</l>
<l>No oriflammes and pennons flare,</l>
<l>No heralds at the lists proclaim</l>
<l>The great grim Arctic giant's name;</l>
<l>But pitiless, and gaunt, and white.</l>
<l>It tilts in silence through the night.</l>

<l>For every morn</l>

<l>The sun came through the gateways of the East</l>

<l>To lackey at their feast.</l>

<l>Did Love of God not hear you cry?</l>
<l>O poor blind faces pillowed on the ooze</l>
<l>Why did God choose</l>

<l>And yet the Soul in whom all beings are</l>

<l>Discerns so deep, foresees so far.</l>

<l>He plans the meadows of a star</l>

<l>Hammering flake to flake</l>

<l>Simply for Beauty's sake.</l>

<l>"Women and children first!"   The whole world hears;</l>

<l>A trumpet blast, a trumpet call,</l>

<l>Sags, totters to its fall,—</l>

<l>So brave and fearless that our spirits see</l>

<l>The Love behind it all.</l>
<l>Yea, in spite of glutted Death we feel</l>
<l>That mightier than the Titan's mighty keel.</l>

<l>The Isle of Song</l>

<l>Wan Memories, with patient widow faces,</l>
<l>Looked calmly backwards thro' the withered years.</l>
<l>And smiled to find, like dew, in distant places.</l>
<l>Forgotten tears.</l>

<l>And in the shadowy grove of cypress-trees,</l>
<l>With ashes on their garments and their hair,</l>
<l>I found a crowd of Sorrows on their knees</l>
<l>Before Despair.</l>

<l>Also, I saw a Dream with misty face.</l>
<l>And heavy languid eyelids lily-white,</l>
<l>Who made a mockery of Time and Space</l>
<l>By day and night.</l>

<l>And Hope I met, with eyes so blue and blind</l>
<l>They could discern the fruit within the pod.</l>
<l>And in the darkness of the world could find</l>
<l>The Love of God.</l>

<l>To call upon his might to save or slay;</l>

<l>When thou with load of glory and of shame.</l>

<l>With crowns of rankling thorn, and withered bay,</l>

<l>Thou with half-finished work, half-ripened fame.</l>

<l>Went forth and cursed and called him, till he came</l>

<l>In a swirl of surging waves, in a cloud of spray,</l>

<l>As dumbly as the sunset overhead</l>
<l>Swoons from its life of amethyst and gold</l>
<l>Into dark death, thou brokest from our hold</l>
<l>And died without a mourner by thy bed.</l>

<l>Not till we turned to kiss thee as of old.</l>
<l>Not till our lips in kissing knew thee cold,</l>
<l>Ah, not till then. Love, knew we thou wert dead.</l>

<l>When didst thou die?  We do not know the hour I</l>
<l>We had forgotten thee in work and play.</l>
<l>And like some delicate and fragile flower</l>
<l>Didst gradually wither day by day,</l>

<l>And though the thought be wise and warm.</l>
<l>And from its womb a world arise,</l>

<l>And in the world strange monsters swarm.</l>
<l>And grow to men with human eyes.</l>

<l>Still, thought is the creative force;</l>

<l>And though the forms of thought decay,</l>
<l>Natheless, the spiritual source.</l>

<l>Of thinking will not pass away.</l>

<l>Brain-cells?   These, too, in thought exist.</l>

<l>Nor cataract nor pool;</l>

<l>It bubbles from a fountain,</l>
<l>And loiters calm and cool.</l>

<l>It ripples not nor revels,</l>
<l>But lisps its lazy tunes.</l>

<l>Along the dusty levels,</l>
<l>Around the sandy dunes.</l>

<l>Across the plains of dreaming</l>

<l>A Blossom of Flowering Seas</l>

<l>No spirit brooded on the placid deep.</l>

<l>Like dead blue eyes that neither laugh nor weep,</l>

<l>There flowered no foam upon the barren shore.</l>

<l>Then wondrously and strangely as a star</l>

<l>Out of a firemist grows,</l>

<l>I saw a billow blossoming afar</l>

<l>Into a rose—</l>

<l>Into the lily, and the rose of thee.</l>

<l>Thou fairy blossom of the flowerless sea.</l>

<l>O, as upon the sea I saw thee float.</l>

<l>From the far nebula I saw unfurled</l>
<l>The beauty of thy body and thy soul.</l>

<l>And huddled women bowed their heads to weep.</l>

<l>Then God was wroth, and made His lightning leap.</l>

<l>And rolled His loudest thunder to arraign</l>

<l>A fear so blindly foolishly profane,</l>

<l>Bewailing Love whom all the angels keep.</l>

<l>And thou blasphemest, thinking that my heart</l>
<l>Has lost the love that made it burn and thrill;</l>
<l>Altho' the first wild rapture may depart.</l>
