TO "LITTLE" BELGIUM

$$I
$$"There was war in Heaven" (Rev. xii. 7)
Surely 'twas hell, not heaven, where first was war, 
<l rend="indent4">Where first infernal passions woke and stirred --
<l rend="indent4">War, which makes heaven impossible in a word,
And Murder bids her bloody gate unbar!

As well might one, under the Juggernaut car, 
<l rend="indent4">And knowing all annihilate shall be, 
<l rend="indent4">Babble of life and immortality
As call that "heaven" where hell and hatred are.

Yet there was war in heaven, as on this star, 
<l rend="indent4">Yea, even there was War's red flag unfurled, 
<l rend="indent4">As if High God would warn a craven world
In heaven itself; worse can befall than war.

<pb n="21"/>
$$II
$$"Give peace in our time, O Lord!" (Prayer Book)
So runs the ancient prayer, and I who hold 
<l rend="indent4">War to be bloody, damnable, abhorred,
<l rend="indent4">Pray: "Not in our time, only, be it Lord, 
But for all time may peace this isle enfold!"

Yet rather than our England cease to be
<l rend="indent4">What England is -- Honour's own diadem;
<l rend="indent4">Rather than fail one promised sword to them 
(Our word, God's arm, their surest guarantee),

That "little" but loyal race whom, near and far, 
<l rend="indent4">A world acclaims for glorious, deathless deed,
<l rend="indent4">Rather than fail GREAT Belgium in her need, 
Rather than this, in God's own name, be war!

THE TRIBUTE

Not by the valour of Belgium, nor the lightning sabre of France,
Not by the thunder of Britain's Fleet, and the Bear's unchecked advance,
Not by these fears, Lord Kaiser, tho' they shatter a tyrant's lust,
Is your heart most darkly troubled, and your soul brought down to the dust,

But by the great affirming of the lands we have knit as one;
By the love, by the passionate loyal love, of each separate free-born son,
Canada cries "We are coming!" and Australasia "We come!"
And you scowl that no Boer is rising at the beat of your German drum.

And the Men of Ind bear witness -- We have grumbled, but now no more;
We have shared your plentiful righteous Peace, we will share your righteous War,
<pb n="23"/>
Trust us to guard your Honour, one with yours is our breath;
You have dealt us an even justice, we are yours to the gates of Death.

Here in these storm-swept islands where we fought for the things of peace,
Where we quarrelled and strove in factions, at a stroke all factions cease,
And there in the vast dominions, more free than your Prussian lords,
The women are shouting for England and the men are drawing their swords.

Never was flag so world-loved as the flag we lift on high,
While your Prussian legions muster, while your Eagle screams in the sky;
And the God of Right give answer to your blood-and-iron brag,
Whether your hand is worthy to wrest from our hand that flag.

IN THE RED DAWN

Oh, my England! thou hast heard --
Could the hearing leave thee cold ? --
Shattered vow and shameless word,
Bribe and menace and affront;
Think they that thou growest old
Since La Haie and Hougoumont?

Oh, my England! thou hast seen,
Not with dull or hopeless eyes,
How they wait, elate, serene,
For thine utter darkening;
How they hover o'er the prize,
Eagles red of claw and wing!

Thou hast heard -- and they shall hear;
Thou hast seen -- and they shall see;
With the sun upon thy spear,
And the moon upon thy helm,
Thou hast spoken, thou art free --
Thou shalt strike and overwhelm. 

<pb n="25"/>
Thou art ours, and we are thine, 
And the circling sea is ours; 
In the dark immortal wine 
We will pledge them, though we die. 
For flame still upon our towers
Flags of hope and victory.

THE WAR CRY

Grim the struggle we've to face!
<l rend="indent">Setting now our task about, 
As becomes our name and race,
<l rend="indent">Grimly we must fight it out.
Not elated, not depressed,
<l rend="indent">Equanimity our rule;
Through all happenings self-possessed,
<l rend="indent">Silent, strong, determined, cool.

Came the challenge from the foe;
<l rend="indent">Naught we did to court this fight;
But since they will have it so,
<l rend="indent">Let them have -- what they invite.
For a Europe's flouted laws
<l rend="indent">We the sword reluctant drew,
Righteous in a righteous cause:
<l rend="indent">Britons, we must see it through.

<pb n="29"/>
Wooden walls once held these strands
<l rend="indent">Safe from every foe that came.
Times are changed; but now our land's
<l rend="indent">Iron walls shall do the same.
Times are changed -- our sailors, nay!
<l rend="indent">What their sea-sires were they are.
Drake's and Nelson's heart to-day
<l rend="indent">Beats in every British tar.

While they range the Northern deep,
<l rend="indent">Lies our sea-girt isle secure;
Britain's honour's theirs to keep
<l rend="indent">Trust we them to keep it sure.
What though random mine shall deal
<l rend="indent">Here and there its dastard blow,
They'll avenge each shattered keel
<l rend="indent">Twice, thrice over, on the foe.

<l rend="italic">Came the challenge from the foe;
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Naught we did to court this fight;</hi>
<l rend="italic">But since they will have it so,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Let them have -- what they invite.</hi>

THE HUSH

There is a hush before the thunder-jar, 
When white the steeples against purple stand:
There is a hush when night with star on star 
Goes ashen on the summer like a brand. 
Now a more awful pause appals the soul, 
When concentrating armies crouch to spring;
Stillness more fraught than any thunder-roll, 
Dawn European with a redder wing. 
The Teuton host no conscience onward drives; 
Sullen they come; to slaughter shepherded; 
Timed for the shambles with unwilling lives, 
With doubt each soldier is already dead. 
The massed battalions as a myth shall reel;
Vainly they fight, if first they cannot feel.

ALLITERATIVISM
$$(THE LATEST SCHOOL)
<note>[French airmen have been flying over Baden and Bavaria, violating Belgian neutrality. -- Stated, on German authority, in "Westminster Gazette."]</note>

See the flying French depart 
Like the bees of Bonaparte, 
Swarming up with a most venomous vitality. 
Over Baden and Bavaria, 
And Brighton and Bulgaria, 
Thus violating Belgian neutrality.

And the injured Prussian may 
Not unreasonably say 
"Why, it cannot be so small a nationality! 
Since Brixton and Batavia, 
Bolivia and Belgravia, 
Are bursting with the Belgian neutrality."

Beluchistan and Bonn, 
Braemar and Babylon
<pb n="37"/> 
All feel the French offence against legality, 
And Boston and Bilbao 
And Bucks and Bulawayo 
Will perish for their Belgian neutrality.

By pure Alliteration 
You may trace this curious nation, 
And respect this somewhat scattered principality; 
When you see a B in Both 
You may take your Bible oath 
You are violating Belgian neutrality.

TO THE AGGRESSOR

Not ours the stroke, for we maintain 
The Truth by which the just abide, 
That murder is the lust of Hell. 
If Europe must be crucified, 
Not ours the guilt! Let it be known. 
<l rend="italic">Aye! by the blood upon thy throne!

Not ours this war, and all its waste, 
Nor do we take the sword in vain --
The Holy Sword our fathers bore 
To brand it with the mark of Cain. 
"Thou art the Man !" For thee 'twas planned. 
<l rend="italic">Aye! by the Bible in thy hand!

EVENING PRAYER OF A PEOPLE
$$SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1914

Lord, from this storm-awakened isle,
<l rend="indent">At this dark hour on land and sea, 
'Twixt bugle-call and Sabbath bell
<l rend="indent">Go up our prayers to Thee.

For the long years of sanctuary
<l rend="indent">We tender thanks, O Lord!
For peaceful fields and sacred hearths,
<l rend="indent">And the unused sword.

Thine be the praise! And now when quakes
<l rend="indent">The world, and trials come, 
O God! preserve inviolate
<l rend="indent">Our ancient island Home!

O! had we died untried, unproved,
<l rend="indent">And missed this hour of stress! --
Praise be to God for this last gift, 
<l rend="indent">The joy of steadfastness! 

<pb n="40"/>
Where'er our people be to-night, 
<l rend="indent">Our husbands or our sons,
Tossed on the thunder-bolted deep, 
<l rend="indent">Or bivouacked by the guns;

Treading the mire of foreign lands,
<l rend="indent">Or guarding our native coasts, 
Be Thou their Shield and Comforter, 
<l rend="indent">We pray Thee, God of Hosts!

THE MAN FORSWORN

Who draws to-day the unrighteous sword?
<l rend="indent">Behold him stand, the Man Forsworn, 
The warrior of the faithless word,
<l rend="indent">The pledge disowned, the covenant torn, 
Who prates of honour, truth, and trust, 
Ere he profanes them in the dust.

When to yon fabric grey in fame,
<l rend="indent">That Windsor lifts against the sky, 
In martial cloak the Kaiser came,
<l rend="indent">We did not dream it cloaked a spy; 
Yet there he sat, as now we know, 
A guest, a kinsman, and a foe.

France was a gallant foe and fair,
<l rend="indent">That looked us proudly in the face, 
With her frank eyes and freeborn air,
<l rend="indent">And valour half-concealed in grace. 
Noblest of all with whom we strove, 
At last she gives us noble love.

<pb n="42"/>
But he that took our proffered hand,
<l rend="indent">Thinking to take our birthright too,
He, in this hospitable land,
<l rend="indent">Bore him as only dastards do. 
Here, where the Earth still nurtures men, 
His hand shall soil not ours again.

We know his people great and strong;
<l rend="indent">On such as these we cast no slur; 
Our wonder is that they so long
<l rend="indent">Suffer ungalled his bit and spur. 
'Tis with no heart of joy that we 
Arise to smite them on the sea.

Glory we count of lesser worth
<l rend="indent">Than wife and babe and hearth and home; 
Theirs is the mandate speeding forth
<l rend="indent">Our steps of thunder on the foam; 
For them we fight, for them we stand, 
Yea, and for faith 'twixt land and land.

You that have linked your might with ours, 
<l rend="indent">To break his pride who breaks the laws, 
You wear today, 'mid perjured Powers, 
<l rend="indent">The armour of a spotless cause;
<pb n="43"/>
Your legions march in Truth arrayed, 
And knightly Honour whets your blade.

From Baltic or Biscayan shores
<l rend="indent">Where Loire to the Atlantic runs; 
Where Volga to the Caspian pours,
<l rend="indent">You have not poured in vain your sons. 
From laughing lands of Rhone and Seine 
You have not poured your sons in vain.

Let us a League of Man proclaim
<l rend="indent">Against such knavery 'neath a crown 
As would be rightly held to shame
<l rend="indent">A swineherd and his fellow clown. 
Shall all the false and creeping things 
Find a last refuge among Kings?

At least on this unageing throne,
<l rend="indent">That baffles the long siege of Time, 
We have a monarch of our own
<l rend="indent">To whom a crime is still a crime;
And pure in aim there sits afar 
The patient, silent, storm-worn Czar.

<pb n="44"/>
For one sole mortal it remained,
<l rend="indent">One rash insulter of the Earth,
To teach the world wherein he reigned
<l rend="indent">How much a Kaiser's word is worth.
A Kaiser's word, a Caitiff's vow!
Well have we learned their value now.

Over the bland and kindly Day,
<l rend="indent">Unseasonable Night he flings;
Sinister darkness blear and grey,
<l rend="indent">A horror of malignant wings.
Pain and red havoc he bestows
On them that only asked repose.

He is not hungrier for your lands
<l rend="indent">Than he is thirsty for your seas.
Smite him with all your thunderous hands,
<l rend="indent">Fight him and smite him to his knees --
You that on him and falsehood hurled
Shall guard the fortress of the world.

TO THE KING OF THE BELGIANS

Multitudes upon multitudes they throng 
And thicken: who shall number their array? 
They bid the peoples tremble and obey: 
Their faces are set forward, all for wrong. 
They trample on the covenant and are strong 
And terrible. Who shall dare to say them nay? 
How shall a little nation bar the way 
Where that resistless host is borne along?

You never thought, O! gallant King, to bow 
To overmastering force and stand aside. 
Safe and secure you might have reigned. But now 
Your Belgium is transfigured, glorified, 
The friend of France and England, who avow 
An Equal here, and thank the men who died.

THE VINDICATION
<note>[It is announced that all the Territorial battalions are already at full strength, and that Lord Kitchener's "second army" is now in course of formation.]</note>

The Summer wanes: and, 'Erbert, in the haunts
<l rend="indent4">That have been hallowed by your yearly favour 
The "fag" that you affect no longer flaunts
<l rend="indent14">Its unattractive savour.

Your bare but lustrous poll, your lurid ties,
<l rend="indent4">The wond'rous garb you choose for your adorning 
At Margate gladden no expectant eyes;
<l rend="indent14">And Southend is in mourning.

The rail you used, in your adjacent park,
<l rend="indent4">Whereon to perch, that girls might glance in gladness, 
Stands tenantless (and they, I may remark,
<l rend="indent14">Show little trace of sadness).

<pb n="47"/>
Your expert views of 'Ayward, 'Obbs, and 'Itch
<l rend="indent4">Disturb no more the matutinal travel
And "form" -- You scarcely know which horse is which --
<l rend="indent14">No longer you unravel.

You have been, more or less, an ornament,
<l rend="indent4">Too precious for the strenuous endeavour
Of those on getting goals, or wickets, bent;
<l rend="indent14">And not unduly clever.

We held you as a nuisance at your worst,
<l rend="indent4">And at your best a useless sort of blighter,
Never imagining that you might burst,
<l rend="indent14">Some day, into a fighter.

We've heard you call on God to save the King,
<l rend="indent4">And shout the "Marseillaise" -- somewhat shyly --
But, still, your martial ardour was a thing
<l rend="indent14">We did not value highly.

Yet, in the altered circumstances, 'Erb,
<l rend="indent4">We feel that in our world there's something lacking --
The place has grown more sombre, less superb, 
<l rend="indent14">Since you have started packing!

<pb n="48"/>
We held your thews and sinews rather cheap, 
<l rend="indent4">Knowing you'd never been inclined to use them;
And might, had not emotion run so deep,
<l rend="indent14">Have ventured to refuse them:

But -- here's where our apology comes in --
<l rend="indent4">The hour of need was all we lacked to try you! 
So, 'Erb, my hero, march along and win:
<l rend="indent14">The God of Wars stand by you!
