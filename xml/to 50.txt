<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">LET others comfort your distress</l>
<l>With soldier tales of simple art,</l>
<l>Telling his strength, his manliness,</l>
<l>The noble way he played his part.</l>
<l>You should be proud; -- ah, gallant heart,</l>
<l>Say not that pride is comfortless.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I have rarer words than praise,</l>
<l>For more than common love was mine,</l>
<l>And now his dear remembered ways</l>
<l>Are treasured in the sacred shrine</l>
<l>Where human mingles with divine,</l>
<l>A solace for the lonely days.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He battled for no worldly hire,</l>
<l>No stern ambition to appease,</l>
<l>From fight to fight his heart's desire</l>
<l>Was set on higher things than these --</l>
<l>His home beside the English seas,</l>
<l>And children's faces round the fire,</l></lg>

<pb n="92"/>
<lg>
<l>Red clouds, and the low sun agleam</l>
<l>In cottage windows dim with age,</l>
<l>The summer sounds of wood and stream,</l>
<l>These were his faith, his heritage;</l>
<l>His life -- a happy pilgrimage,</l>
<l>And death the dawning of a dream.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And on that day he went to die</l>
<l>His spirit soared on rainbow wings,</l>
<l>Gladly he went, with head held high,</l>
<l>And singing as a lover sings</l>
<l>To greet the dusky night, that brings</l>
<l>His hour of happiness more nigh.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Ah, surely when his life was sped</l>
<l>That spirit hastened to your side.</l>
<l>Would you but raise your weeping head</l>
<l>You'd hear him whisper in the tide,</l>
<l>Or on the winds of heaven ride</l>
<l>For ever with the mighty dead.</l></lg>

<l n="1">HUMBLY, O England, we offer what is of little worth,
Just our bodies and souls and everything else we have;
But thou with thy holy cause wilt hallow our common earth,
Giving us strength in the battle -- and peace, if need, in the grave.

Humble, O England, we are, for of hero-fathers we come,
Men that contested with tyrants the mightier destinies;
Philip of Spain we remember, and the ships that never went home,
And him that was caught at last, and isled in the warder seas.

<pb n="100"/>
Humbly, O England, we bring thee life in its folly-stained youth,
That which, it may be, has striven, but ever has slackened and tired;
The faltering, often deceived, to combat now for the Truth,
Dim-visioned, to smite for the morrow unknown but desired.

Sailing for Flanders

TO need any more the skies or man to importune
For us departing to-day with spirits at peace,
Now that the inner warfares, that tire men, cease --
For us the chosen of God's lot, the spoilt darlings of Fortune.

Against the beasts in men let loose from their cages
We go forth with a lightened and proud heart,
We who are the men summoned to a high part,
To be known of the envious youth of unborn ages.

<pb n="101"/>
We have feared old Death, but now have we learned our error,
Seeing him there in the mire us so kindly await --
A comrade befitting the hour of a world's fate,
And we look him full in the eyes; we are rid of our last terror.

True that Death is an ill, but the worse ills are many;
Shame and slow rotting, cold and greasy years,
Pride in dishonour -- these things hold our fears;
We can play pitch and toss with our lives as a boy with a penny.

We have spent ourselves to win us a lady's favour,
But now the spending is grown to a leaping fire,
And winning for ourselves seems but a strange desire;
Her eyes are remote as stars; her kisses have lost their savour.

We have put life away and spurn the ways of the living;
We have broken with the old selves who gathered and got,
And are free with the freedom of men who have not;
We partake the heroic fervours of giving and again giving.

<pb n="102"/>
Was it only for Death we were borne of our Mothers?
Only for Death created the dear love of our wives?
Only for Death and in vain we endeavoured our lives?
Yea, life was given to be given; March onward, my brothers!
<hi rend="italic">January</hi>, 1915.


Two Julys

I WAS so vague in 1914; tossed
Upon too many purposes, and worthless;
Moody; to this world or the other lost,
Essential nowhere; without calm and mirthless
And now I have gained one for many ends,
See my straight road stretch out so white, so slender,
That happy road, the road of all my friends,
Made glad with peace, and holy with surrender.

Proud, proud we fling to the winds of Time our token,
And in our need there wells in us the power,
<pb n="103"/>
Given England's swords to keep her honour clean.
Which they shall be which pierce, and which be broken,
We know not, but we know that every hour
We must shine brighter, take an edge more keen.
<hi rend="italic">July</hi>, 1915.


In Honorem Fortium

I SOMETIMES think that I have lived too long,
Who have heard so many a gay brave singer's song
Fail him for ever -- seen so many sails
Lean out resplendent to the evil gales,
Then Death, the wrecker, get his harvest in.
Oh, ill it is, when men lose all, to win;
Grief though it be to die, 'tis grief yet more
To live and count the dear dead comrades o'er.

<milestone unit="stanza" rend="dots">.  .  .  .  .  .</milestone>

Peace. After all you died not. We've no fear
But that, long ages hence, you will be near --
A thought by night --on the warm wind a breath,
Making for courage, putting old Death,
<pb n="104"/>
Living wherever men are not afraid
Of aught but making bravery a parade.
Yes, parleying with fear, they'll pause and say,
"At Gommecourt boys suffered worse that day";
Or, hesitating on some anxious brink,
They will become heroic when they think,
"Did they not rise mortality above
Who staked a lifetime all made sweet with love?"

Captain, Royal Scots

My Country

THERE is no dearer land in all the world
Than thee, my country, girded by the sea,
Where rocks re-echo to the bounding waters hurl'd,
And all is endless sight and mystery to me.
The silent distances of hills, replete
With tideless joy, eternal hope
Upspringing with the eagle's pennon-beat,
Free to the airs, with ne'er a tether-rope
To check its flight.

The sky above may weep, and seldom smile,
And mirky be the frown upon thy brow.
Yet O! thy mountain woods and endless mile
Of sea, sing joy unbound, and life, that now
Expansive breathes the freshness of the free.
Thy piney airs and salt-sea breezes blown,
With peaty scent and loamy breath of lea
Seek out the soul that nowhere else hath known
The like to thee.

<pb n="106"/>
There is no dearer land in all the world
Than thee, my country, girded by the sea.
'Twere joy to those who bear the flag unfurl'd
In ruthless strife to keep thine acres free,
To dip the hand in blood, the face to scar
With sword of death, that thou unconquered may
For Freedom stand, the vanquisher of war,
Chaste guardian of the unprotected way
To peace and right.

HARLEY MATTHEWS
Private, A.I.F.

Homeward

To the old friends and faces,
To the old life again,
To often dreamed-of places,
Pleasant in sun or rain:
For home my face is set;
Home! Madly goes my heart
With calling up each minute
Those visions none forget,
All that the word has in it --
For each man things apart.

We watched our land go from us,
The sea stretched far, unknown;
To all it glowed with promise. ...
I watch the sea alone.
Some lie within its sound,
Scarce past its edge of foam,
Yet hear it surging never.
And some their grave have found
Far from the sea for ever,
The sea that takes us home.

<pb n="108"/>
I hear you, waves that glisten,
I see your path for me.
Maybe the dead can listen,
See more than I can see:
Not for the gulls, their sound
Heard muffled through the loam,
Nor noise of sea or heavens.
Not see the trees around,
No! not the grass-roots even,
But sounds and sights of home.

God's Acre

Dedicated to my "skipper," Captain Alan Cookson (killed in action 27th June, 1917), who now sleeps eternally in the shadow of the little grey church at ...

WHEN sands of Time have run their course
And mortal heart is stilled,
We render back unto its Source
The dust that He fulfilled;

And in some still, subdu&eacute;d spot
Where all is peace, and they
Who walk the silent paths are taught
To meditate and pray,

We to that dust its rest afford
And dry our idle tears
For Death is peace, and Peace adored
Reigns here throughout the years.
