<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">D<hi rend="smallcaps">ark</hi>, dark, lay the drifters, against the red west,</l>
<l>As they shot their long meshes of steel overside;</l>
<l>And the oily green waters were rocking to rest</l>
<l>When <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> went out, at the turn of the tide.</l>
<l>And nobody knew where that lassie would roam,</l>
<l>For the magic that called her was tapping unseen.</l>
<l>It was well nigh a week ere <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> came home,</l>
<l>And nobody knew where <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> had been.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>She'd a gun at her bow that was Newcastle's best,</l>
<l>And a gun at her stern that was fresh from the Clyde,</l>
<l>And a secret her skipper had never confessed,</l>
<l>Not even at dawn, to his newly wed bride;</l>
<l>And a wireless that whispered above like a gnome,</l>
<l>The laughter of London, the boasts of Berlin.</l>
<l>O, it may have been mermaids that lured her from home,</l>
<l>But nobody knew where <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> had been.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It was dark when <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> came home from her quest,</l>
<l>With her bridge dabbled red where her skipper had died;</l>
<l>But she moved like a bride with a rose at her breast;</l>
<l>And "Well done, <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny!</hi>" the admiral cried.</l>
<pb n="196"/>
<l>Now at sixty-four fathom a conger may come,</l>
<l>And nose at the bones of a drowned submarine;</l>
<l>But late in the evening <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> came home,</l>
<l>And nobody knew where <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> had been.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There's a wandering shadow that stares at the foam,</l>
<l>Though they sing all night to old England, their queen,</l>
<l>Late, late in the evening <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> came home,</l>
<l>And nobody knew where <hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi> had been.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">S<hi rend="smallcaps">ometimes</hi> I fly at dawn above the sea,</l>
<l>Where, underneath, the restless waters flow --</l>
<l>Silver, and cold, and slow,</l>
<l>Dim in the east there burns a new-born sun,</l>
<l>Whose rosy gleams along the ripples run,</l>
<l>Save where the mist droops low,</l>
<l>Hiding the level loneliness from me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now appears beneath the milk-white haze</l>
<l>A little fleet of anchored ships, which lie</l>
<l>In clustered company,</l>
<l>And seem as they are yet fast bound by sleep,</l>
<l>Although the day has long begun to peep,</l>
<l>With red-inflam&egrave;d eye,</l>
<l>Along the still, deserted ocean ways.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The fresh, cold wind of dawn blows on my face</l>
<l>As in the sun's raw heart I swiftly fly,</l>
<l>And watch the seas glide by.</l>
<pb n="199"/>
<l>Scarce human seem I, moving through the skies</l>
<l>And far removed from warlike enterprise --</l>
<l>Like some great gull on high</l>
<l>Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then do I feel with God quite, quite alone,</l>
<l>High in the virgin morn, so white and still,</l>
<l>And free from human ill:</l>
<l>My prayers transcend my feeble earth-bound plaints --</l>
<l>As though I sang among the happy Saints</l>
<l>With many a holy thrill --</l>
<l>As though the glowing sun were God's bright Throne.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My flight is done. I cross the line of foam</l>
<l>That break around a town of grey and red,</l>
<l>Whose streets and squares lie dead</l>
<l>Beneath the silent dawn -- then am I proud</l>
<l>That England's peace to guard I am allowed;</l>
<l>Then bow my humble head,</l>
<l>In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">O<hi rend="smallcaps">h</hi>, down by Millwall Basin as I went the other day,</l>
<l>I met a skipper that I knew, and to him I did say:</l>
<l>"Now what's the cargo, Captain, that brings you up this way?"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Oh, I've been up and down (said he) and round about also...</l>
<l>From Sydney to the Skagerack, and Kiel to Callao...</l>
<l>With a leaking steam-pipe all the way to Californ-i-o...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"With pots and pans and ivory fans and every kind of thing,</l>
<l>Rails and nails and cotton bales, and sewer pipes and string...</l>
<l>But now I'm through with cargoes, and I'm here to serve the King!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="201"/>
<l>"And if it's sweeping mines (to which my fancy somewhat leans)</l>
<l>Or hanging out with booby-traps for the skulking submarines,</l>
<l>I'm here to do my blooming best and give the beggars beans!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"A rough job and a tough job is the best job for me,</l>
<l>And what or where I don't much care, I'll take what it may be,</l>
<l>For a tight place is the right place when it's foul weather at sea!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>. . . . . . . . . . .</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There's not a port he does n't know from Melbourne to New York;</l>
<l>He's as hard as a lump of harness beef, and as salt as pickled pork...</l>
<l>And he'll stand by a wreck in a murdering gale and count it part of his work!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He's the terror of the fo'c's'le when he heals its various ills</l>
<l>With turpentine and mustard leaves, and poultices and pills...</l>
<l>But he knows the sea like the palm of his hand, as a shepherd knows the hills.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He'll spin you yarns from dawn to dark -- and half of 'em are true!</l>
<l>He swears in a score of languages, and maybe talks in two!</l>
<l>And... he'll lower a boat in a hurricane to save a drowning crew.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="202"/>
<l>A rough job or a tough job -- he's handled two or three --</l>
<l>And what or where he won't much care, nor ask what the risk may be ...</l>
<l>For a tight place is the right place when it's wild weather at sea!</l></lg>
