<head rend="center">Nor the wailing of the fife.</l>
<l>Trumpets blaring to the charge</l>
<l>Were the music of his life.</l>

<lg>
<l>Of his patience, of his calm,</l>
<l>Of his quiet faithfulness,</l>
<l>England, raise your hero's cairn!</l>
<l>He is worthy of no less.</l>
<l>Stone by stone, in silence laid,</l>
<l>Singly, surely, let it grow.</l>
<l>He whose living was to serve,</l>
<l>Would have had it so.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There's a body drifting down</l>
<l>For the mighty sea to keep.</l>
<l>There's a spirit cannot die</l>
<l>While a heart is left to leap</l>
<l>In the land he gave his all,</l>
<l>Steel alike to praise and hate.</l>

<l>He has saved the life he spent,</l>
<l>Death has struck too late.</l></lg>
