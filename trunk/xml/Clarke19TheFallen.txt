<l n="1">B<hi rend="smallcaps">low</hi> out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!</l>
<l>There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,</l>
<l>But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.</l>
<l>These laid the world away; poured out the red</l>
<l>Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be</l>
<l>Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene</l>
<l>That men call age; and those who would have been,</l>
<l>Their sons, they gave, their immortality.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,</l>
<l>Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.</l>
<l>Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,</l>
<l>And paid his subjects with a royal wage;</l>
<l>And Nobleness walks in our ways again;</l>
<l>And we have come into our heritage.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">II</head>
<l>These hearts were woven of human joys and cares</l>
<l>Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.</l>
<l>The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,</l>
<l>And sunset, and the colours of the earth.</l>
<l>These had seen movement and heard music; known</l>
<l>Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;</l>
<l>Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;</l>
<l>Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="224"/>
<l>There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter</l>
<l>And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,</l>
<l>Frost with a gesture, stays the waves that dance</l>
<l>And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white</l>
<l>Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,</l>
<l>A width, a shining peace, under the night.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">H<hi rend="smallcaps">ere</hi>, where we stood together, we three men,</l>
<l>Before the war had swept us to the East</l>
<l>Three thousand miles away, I stand again</l>
<l>And hear the bells, and breathe, and go to feast.</l>
<l>We trod the same path, to the selfsame place,</l>
<l>Yet here I stand, having beheld their graves,</l>
<l>Skyros whose shadows the great seas erase,</l>
<l>And Seddul Bahr that ever more blood craves.</l>
<l>So, since we communed here, our bones have been</l>
<l>Nearer, perhaps, than they again will be,</l>
<l>Earth and the worldwide battle lie between,</l>
<l>Death lies between, and friend-destroying sea.</l>
<l>Yet here, a year ago, we talked and stood</l>
<l>As I stand now, with pulses beating blood.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I saw her like a shadow on the sky</l>
<l>In the last light, a blur upon the sea,</l>
<l>Then the gale's darkness put the shadow by,</l>
<l>But from one grave that island talked to me;</l>
<l>And, in the midnight, in the breaking storm,</l>
<l>I saw its blackness and a blinking light,</l>
<pb n="225"/>
<l>And thought, "So death obscures your gentle form,</l>
<l>So memory strives to make the darkness bright;</l>
<l>And, in that heap of rocks, your body lies,</l>
<l>Part of the island till the planet ends,</l>
<l>My gentle comrade, beautiful and wise,</l>
<l>Part of this crag this bitter surge offends,</l>
<l>While I, who pass, a little obscure thing,</l>
<l>War with this force, and breathe, and am its king."</l></lg>

<l>England mourns for her dead across the sea.</l>
<l>Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,</l>
<l>Fallen in the cause of the free.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal</l>
<l>Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres,</l>
<l>There is music in the midst of desolation</l>
<l>And a glory that shines upon our tears.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They went with songs to the battle, they were young,</l>
<l>Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.</l>
<l>They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;</l>
<l>They fell with their faces to the foe.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old:</l>

<l>They sleep beyond England's foam.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But where our desires are and our hopes profound,</l>
<l>Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,</l>
<l>To the innermost heart of their own land they are known</l>
<l>As the stars are known to the Night;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,</l>
<l>Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;</l>
<l>As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,</l>
<l>To the end, to the end, they remain.</l></lg>

<l>And this we know: Death is not Life effete,</l>

<l>Victor and vanquished are a-one in death:</l>

<l>"Come, what was your record when you drew breath?"</l>
<l>But a big blot has hid each yesterday</l>
<l>So poor, so manifestly incomplete.</l>
<l>And your bright Promise, withered long and sped,</l>
<l>Is touched, stirs, rises, opens and grows sweet</l>
<l>And blossoms and is you, when you are dead.</l></lg>

<l>Already some have launched new lives:</l>
<l>A little daughter, little son --</l>
<l>For thus this blundering world goes on.</l>
<l>But never more will any see</l>

<l>Before the world went mad.</l>

<l>Like babes, refreshed from sleep, like children, we rose,</l>
<l>Brimming with deep content, from our dreamless repose.</l>
<l>And, "What do you call it?" asked one. "I thought I was dead."</l>
<l>"You are," cried another. "We're all of us dead and flat."</l>
<l>"I'm alive as a cricket. There's something wrong with your head."</l>
<l>They stretched their limbs and argued it out where they sat.</l>
<pb n="239"/>
<l>And over the wide field friend and foe</l>
<l>Spoke of small things, remembering not old woe</l>
<l>Of war and hunger, hatred and fierce words.</l>
<l>They sat and listened to the brooks and birds,</l>
<l>And watched the starlight perish in pale flame</l>
<l>Wondering what God would look like when He came.</l></lg>

<l n="1">W<hi rend="smallcaps">e</hi> may not know how fared your soul before</l>
<l>Occasion came to try it by this test.</l>
<l>Perchance, it used on lofty wings to soar;</l>
<l>Again, it may have dwelt in lowly nest.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We do not know if bygone knightly strain</l>
<l>Impelled you then, or blood of humble clod</l>
<l>Defied the dread adventure to attain</l>
<l>The cross of honor or the peace of God.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We see but this, that when the moment came</l>
<l>You raised on high, then drained, the solemn cup --</l>
<l>The grail of death; that, touched by valor's flame,</l>
<l>The kindled spirit burned the body up.</l></lg>

<l>Twitter of mating birds, flutter of wings</l>

<l>A voice for ever stilled, a memory,</l>

<l n="1">O<hi rend="smallcaps">h</hi>, red is the English rose,</l>
<l>And the lilies of France are pale,</l>
<l>And the poppies grow in the golden wheat,</l>
<l>For the men whose eyes are heavy with sleep,</l>
<l>Where the ground is red as the English rose,</l>
<l>And the lips as the lilies of France are pale,</l>
<l>And the ebbing pulses beat fainter and fainter and fail.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Oh, red is the English rose,</l>
<l>And the lilies of France are pale.</l>
<l>And the poppies lie in the level corn</l>
<l>For the men who sleep and never return.</l>
<l>But wherever they lie an English rose</l>
<l>So red, and a lily of France so pale,</l>
<l>Will grow for a love that never and never can fail.</l></lg>
