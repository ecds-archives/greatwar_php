When last heard from, the author, who is a British officer, was on service at Khartoum.</note>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Behind</hi> us in vermilion state</l>
<l>The sun fell to the rustling sea,</l>
<l>The grey-green twilight came and went,</l>
<l>And night involved my friend and me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now Egypt donned her fairest robes</l>
<l>Of glimmering moonshine cool and clear:</l>
<l>No more we talked, and silently</l>
<l>Made o'er the waste to Abu Qir.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For, with the twilight, twilight dreams</l>
<l>Had come and borne our souls away,</l>
<l>Though still our bodies onward fared</l>
<l>Toward the palm-trees and the bay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And my companion now, I think,</l>
<l>With brother-artists once again</l>
<l>Was painting in the atelier,</l>
<l>Or down some dear Parisian lane</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="2"/>
<l>Was seeking with a motley throng</l>
<l>That well-remembered brasserie,</l>
<l>And Trilby, hanging on his arm,</l>
<l>Was laughing at him merrily.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But I, ah, where was I? Afar</l>
<l>I'd flown to that enchanted shore,</l>
<l>Where o'er white-flashing waves the wind</l>
<l>From Donegal to Mullaghmore</l>
<l>Comes gallivanting bold and free --</l>
<l rend="indent">God grant again I there may be,</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1" rend="italic">America!</l>
<l rend="italic">England's cheeky kid brother,</l>
<l rend="italic">Who bloodily assaulted your august elder</l>
<l rend="italic">At Bunker Hill and similar places</l>
<l rend="italic">(Not mentioned in our history books),</l>
<l rend="italic">What can I tell you of war or of peace?</l>
<l rend="italic">Say, have you forgotten 1861?</l>
<l rend="italic">Bull Run, Gettysburg, Fredericksburg?</l>
<l rend="italic">Your million dead?</l>
<l rend="italic">Tell me,</l>
<l rend="italic">Was that the greatest time of your lives</l>
<l rend="italic">Or the most disastrous?</l>
<l rend="italic">Who knows? Not you; not I.</l>
<l rend="italic">Who can tell the end of this war?</l>
<l rend="italic">And say, brother Jonathan,</l>
<l rend="italic">D'you know what it's all about?</l>
<l rend="italic">Let me whisper you a secret -- we don't!</l>
<l rend="italic">We were all too fat with peace,</l>
<l rend="italic">Or perhaps we didn't quite know how good peace was,</l>
<l rend="italic">And so here we are,</l>
<l rend="italic">And we're going to win....</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It's fine to be a soldier,</l>
<l>To get accepted by the recruiting sergeant,</l>
<pb n="4"/>
<l>Be trained, fitted with a uniform and a gun,</l>
<l>Say good-bye to your girl,</l>
<l>And go off to the front</l>
<l>Whistling, "It's a long way to Tipperary."</l>
<l>It's good to march forty miles a day,</l>
<l>Carrying ninety-one pounds on your back,</l>
<l>To eat good coarse food, get blistered, tired out, wounded,</l>
<l>Thirst, starve, fight like a devil</l>
<l>(<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, like you an' me, Jonathan),</l>
<l>With the Maxims zip-zipping</l>
<l>And the shrapnel squealing,</l>
<l>And the howitzers rumbling like the traffic in Piccadilly.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Civilization? --</l>
<l>Jonathan, if you could hear them</l>
<l>Whistling the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Marching Through Georgia</hi>,</l>
<l>You'd want to go too.</l>
<l>Twenty thousand a day, Jonathan!</l>
<l>Perhaps you're more civilized just now than we are,</l>
<l>Perhaps we've only forgotten civilization for a moment,</l>
<l>Perhaps we're really fighting for peace.</l>
<l>And after all it will be more fun afterwards --</l>
<l>More fun for the poets and the painters --</l>
<l>When the cheering's all over</l>
<pb n="5"/>
<l>And the dead men buried</l>
<l>And the rest gone back to their jobs.</l>
<l>It'll be more fun for them to make their patterns,</l>
<l>Their word-patterns and color-patterns.</l>
<l>And after all, there is always war and always peace,</l>
<l>Always the war of the crowds,</l>
<l>Always the great peace of the arts.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Even now,</l>
<l>With the war beating in great waves overhead,</l>
<l>Beating and roaring like great winds and mighty waters,</l>
<l>The sea-gods still pattern the red seaweed fronds,</l>
<l>Still chip the amber into neck-chains</l>
<l>For Leucothea and Thetis.</l>
<l>Even now,</l>
<l>When the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> screams like a hurt woman,</l>
<l>And Paris -- grisette among cities -- trembles with fear,</l>
<l>The poets still make their music</l>
<l>Which nobody listens to,</l>
<l>Which hardly anyone ever listened to.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The great crowds go by,</l>
<l>Fighting over each other's bodies in peace-time,</l>
<l>Fighting over each other's bodies in war-time.</l>
<l>Something of the strife comes to them</l>
<l>In their little, high rock-citadel of art,</l>
<pb n="6"/>
<l>Where they hammer their dreams in gold and copper,</l>
<l>Where they cut them in pine-wood, in Parian stone, in wax,</l>
<l>Where they sing them in sweet bizarre words</l>
<l>To the sound of antiquated shrill instruments;</l>
<l>And they are happy.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The little rock-citadel of the artists</l>
<l>Is always besieged;</l>
<l>There, though they have beauty and silence,</l>
<l>They have always tears and hunger and despair.</l>
<l>But that little citadel has held out</l>
<l>Against all the wars of the world</l>
<l>Like England, brother Jonathan.</l>
<l>It will not fall during the great war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There is always war and always peace;</l>
<l>Always the war of the crowds,</l>
<l>Always the great peace of the arts.</l></lg>

<l>Long weeds like serpents coil and squeeze</l>
<l>Forsaken loves of faithless bees,</l>

<l>Columbines, heartsease, picotees</l>

<head rend="center">UNSER GOTT</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">They</hi> held a great prayer-service in Berlin,</l>
<l>And augured German triumph from some words</l>
<l>Said to be spoken by the Jewish God</l>
<l>To Gideon, which signified that He</l>
<l>Was staunchly partial to the Israelites.</l>
<l>The aisles were thronged; and in the royal box</l>
<l>(I had it from a tourist who was there,</l>
<l>Clutching her passport, anxious, like the rest),</l>
<l>There sat the Kaiser, looking "very sad."</l>
<l>And then they sang; she said it shook the heart.</l>
<l>The women sobbed; tears salted bearded lips</l>
<l>Unheeded; and my friend looked back and saw</l>
<l>A young girl crumple in her mother's arms.</l>
<l>They carried out a score of them, she said,</l>
<l>While German hearts, through bursting German throats</l>
<l>Poured out, <hi rend="italic">Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott!</hi></l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Yea, "Unser Gott! Our strength is <hi rend="italic">Unser</hi> Gott!</l>
<l>Not that light-minded Bon Dieu of France!")</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I think we all have made our God too small.</l>
<l>There was a young man, a good while ago,</l>
<pb n="12"/>
<l>Who taught that doctrine... but they murdered him</l>
<l>Because he wished to share the Jewish God</l>
<l>With other folk.</l>
<l rend="indent18">They are long-lived, these fierce</l>
<l>Old hating Gods of nations; but at last</l>
<l>There surely will be spilled enough of blood</l>
<l>To drown them all! The deeps of sea and air,</l>
<l>Of old the seat of gods, no more are safe,</l>
<l>For mines and monoplanes. The Germans, now,</l>
<l>Can surely find and rout the God of France</l>
<l>With Zeppelins, or some slim mother's son</l>
<l>Of Paris, or of Tours, or Brittany,</l>
<l>Can drop a bomb into the <hi rend="italic">Feste Burg</hi>,</l>
<l>And, having crushed the source of German strength,</l>
<l>Die happy in his blazing monoplane.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Sad jesting! If there be no God at all,</l>
<l>Save in the heart of man, why, even so --</l>
<l>Yea, all the more, -- since we must make our God,</l>
<l>Oh, let us make Him large enough for all,</l>
<l>Or cease to prate of Him! If kings must fight,</l>
<l>Let them fight for their glory, openly,</l>
<l>And plain men for their lands and for their homes,</l>
<l>And heady youths, who go to see the fun,</l>
<l>Blaspheme not God. True, maybe we might leave</l>
<l>The God of Germany to some poor frau</l>
<l>Who cannot go, who can but wait and mourn,</l>
<pb n="13"/>
<l>Except that she will teach Him to her sons --</l>
<l>A God quite scornful of the Slavic soul,</l>
<l>And much concerned to keep Alsace-Lorraine.</l>
<l>They should go godless, too -- the poor, benumbed</l>
<l>Crushed, anguished women, till their hearts can hold</l>
<l>A greater Comforter!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent22">(Yet it is hard</l>
<l>To make Him big enough! For me, I like</l>
<l>The English and the Germans and the French,</l>
<l>The Russians, too; and Servians, I should think,</l>
<l>Might well be very interesting to God.</l>
<l>But, do the best I may, my God is white,</l>
<l>And hardly takes a nigger seriously</l>
<l>This side of Africa. Not those, at least</l>
<l>Who steal my wood, and of a summer night</l>
<l>Keep me awake with shouting, where they sit</l>
<l>With monkey-like fidelity and glee</l>
<l>Grinding through their well-oiled sausage-mill --</l>
<l>The dead machinery of the white man's church --</l>
<l>Raw jungle-fervor, mixed with scraps sucked dry</l>
<l>Of Israel's old sublimities: not those.</l>
<l>And when they threaten us, the Higher Race,</l>
<l>Think you, which side is God's? Oh, let us pray</l>
<l>Lest blood yet spurt to wash that black skin white,</l>
<l>As now it flows because a German hates</l>
<l>A Cossack, and an Austrian a Serb!)</l>
<pb n="14"/>
<l>What was it that he said so long ago,</l>
<l>The young man who outgrew the Jewish God --</l>
<l>"Not a sparrow falleth --?" Ah, God, God,</l>
<l>And there shall fall a million murdered men!</l></lg>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">In</hi> the red country</l>
<l>The sky flowers</l>
<l>All day.</l>
<l>Strange mechanical birds</l>
<l>With struts of wire and glazed wings</l>
<l>Cross the impassive sky</l>
<l>Which burgeons ever and again</l>
<l>With ephemeral unfolding flowers,</l>
<l>White and yellow and brown,</l>
<l>That spread and dissolve.</l>
<l>And smaller rapid droning birds go by,</l>
<l>And bright metallic bees whose sting is death.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behind the hills,</l>
<l>Behind the whispering woods whose leaves are falling</l>
<l>Yellow and red to cover the red clay,</l>
<l>Misshapen monsters squat with wide black maws</l>
<l>Gulping smoke and belching flame.</l>
<l>From the mirk reed beds of the age of coal,</l>
<l>Wallowing out of their sleep in the earlier slime,</l>
<l>They are resurrected and stagger forth to slay --</l>
<l>The prehistoric Beasts we thought were dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="18"/>
<l>They are blinded with long sleep,</l>
<l>But men with clever weapons</l>
<l>Goad them to fresh pastures.</l>
<l>Beside still waters</l>
<l>They drink of blood and neigh a horrible laughter,</l>
<l>And their ponderous tread shakes happy cities down,</l>
<l>And the thresh of their flail-like tails</l>
<l>Makes acres smoulder and smoke</l>
<l>Blackened of golden harvest.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The Beasts are back,</l>
<l>And men, in their spreading shadow,</l>
<l>Inhale the odor of their nauseous breath.</l>
<l>Inebriate with it they fashion other gods</l>
<l>Than the gods of day-dream.</l>
<l>Of iron and steel are little images</l>
<l>Made of the Beasts.</l>
<l>And men rush forth and fling themselves for ritual</l>
<l>Before these gods, before the lumbering Beasts, --</l>
<l>And some make long obeisance.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Umber and violet flowers of the sky,</l>
<l>The sun, like a blazing Mars, clanks across the blue</l>
<l>And plucks you, to fashion into a nosegay</l>
<l>To offer Venus, his old-time paramour.</l>
<l>But now she shrinks</l>
<pb n="19"/>
<l>And pales</l>
<l>Like Cynthia, her more ascetic sister...</l>
<l>Vulcan came to her arms in the grimy garb</l>
<l>Of toil, he smelt of the forge and the racketing workshop,</l>
<l>But not of blood.</l>
<l>And, if she smells these flowers, they bubble ruby blood</l>
<l>That trickles between her fingers.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet is a dream flowing over the red country,</l>
<l>Yet is a light growing, for all the black furrows of the red country...</l>
<l>The machines are foe or friend</l>
<l>As the world desires.</l>
<l>The Beasts shall sleep again.</l>
<l>And in that sleep, when the land is twilight-still</l>
<l>And men take thought among the frozen waves of the dead,</l>
<l>The Sowers go forth once more,</l>
<l>Sowers of vision, sowers of the seed</l>
<l>Of peace or war.</l>
<l>Shall it be peace indeed?</l>
<l>Great shadowy figures moving from hill to hill</l>
<l>Of tangled bodies, with rhythmic stride and cowled averted head,</l>
<l>What do you sow with hands funereal --</l>
<l>New savageries imperial,</l>
<pb n="20"/>
<l>Unthinking pomps for arrogant, witless men?</l>
<l>Or seed for the people in strong democracy?</l>
<l>What do you see</l>
<l>With your secret eyes, and sow for us, that we must reap again?</l></lg>

<l rend="italic">"The Germans have seized the bridge-head at Kart&#x00FA;shkiya-Ber&#x00F3;;za;</l>

<l>Smelling of wide-extending marshes of hay;</l>
<l>Smelling of cornfields;</l>
<l>Smelling of apple-orchards;</l>
<l>Smelling of cherry-trees in full blossom;</l>
<l>Smelling of all the pleasant recollections of my childhood --</l>

<l>Kart&#x00FA;shkiya-Ber&#x00F3;;za!</l></lg>

<l>I see before me a lane running between two rows of straggling cottages --</l>
<l>I cannot remember the name of the lane;</l>
<l>I do not know whether it has any name at all;</l>
<l>But I remember it was broad and unpaven and shaded with wide-branching chestnuts --</l>
<l>And enters the market-place</l>
<l>Just a few houses after my Grandfather's --</l>
<l>Kart&#x00FA;shkiya-Ber&#x00F3;;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see it even now</l>
<l>My Grandfather's house --</l>
<l>On the lane, to the right, as you come from the market-place;</l>
<l>A big, hospitable frame building --</l>
<l>Big like my Grandfather's own heart,</l>
<l>And hospitable like Grandmother's smile --</l>
<l>I can see it even now,</l>
<l>With the white-pillared porch in the centre and the sharp-gabled roof</l>
<l>Pierced with little windows;</l>
<l>And the great quadrangular garden behind it;</l>
<l>And the tall fence surrounding the garden;</l>
<l>And the old well in the corner of the garden;</l>
<l>With the bucket-lift</l>
<l>Rising over the fence --</l>
<l>Kart&#x00FA;shkiya-Ber&#x00F3;;za!</l></lg>

<pb n="34"/>
<l>I can see him even now,</l>
<l>My Grandfather --</l>
<l>Bending over me, tall and sad-eyed and thoughtful</l>
<l>Lifting me up and seating me on his knees</l>
<l>Lovingly,</l>
<l>And listening to all my childish questions and confessions;</l>
<l>Pardoning, admonishing, remonstrating --</l>
<l>Satisfying my interrogative soul with good-humored indulgence --</l>
<l>And my Grandmother,</l>
<l>Dear little woman!</l>
<l>I can never dissociate her from plum-pudding and apple dumplings,</l>
<l>And raisin-cakes and almond cakes and crisp potato pancakes</l>
<l>And the smell of fish frying on the fire --</l>
<l>And then there is my cousin, Miriam,</l>
<l>Who lived in the yellow house across the lane --</l>
<l>A freckle-faced, cherry-eyed little girl with a puckered-up nose.</l>
<l>I was very romantic about her;</l>
<l>And then there is my curse, my rival at school, my arch-enemy --</l>
<l>Jacob,</l>
<l>The synagogue sexton's boy,</l>
<l>On whom 1 was always warring --</l>
<pb n="35"/>
<l>God knows on what battlefield he must be lying now!</l>
<l>And then there is Nathan and Joseph and Berel and Solomon</l>
<l>And Ephraim, the baker's boy,</l>
<l>And Baruch and Gershen and Mendel</l>
<l>And long-legged, sandy-haired Emanuel who fell into the pond with me that time,</l>
<l>While we were skating on the ice --</l>
<l>Kart&#x00FA;shkiya-Ber&#x00F3;;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see myself even now</l>
<l>In the lane on a summer's day,</l>
<l>Cap in hand, chasing after dragon-flies --</l>
<l>Suddenly, near by, sounds the noise of drums and bugles --</l>
<l>I know what that means!</l>
<l>Breathlessly I dash up the lane --</l>
<l>It is the regiment quartered in the barracks at the end of the town, in its annual parade on the highway --</l>
<l>How I would wish to be one of those gray-coated heroes!</l>
<l>I watch them eager-eyed --</l>
<l>And run after them until they reach the Gentile Quarter --</l>
<l>And then I turn back --</l>
<l>Kart&#x00FA;shkiya-Ber&#x00F3;;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="36"/>
<l>I am in the market-place --</l>
<l>At a Fair;</l>
<l>The market-place is a heaving mass of carts and horses and oxen;</l>
<l>The oxen are lowing, the horses are neighing, the peasants are cursing in a dozen different dialects --</l>
<l>I am in Grandfather's store,</l>
<l>On the lower end of the market-place, right opposite the public well --</l>
<l>The store is full of peasants and peasant women, bargaining at the top of their voices;</l>
<l>The men are clad in rough sheepskin coats and fur caps;</l>
<l>The women are gay in bright-colored cottons and wear red kerchiefs around their heads;</l>
<l>My Grandfather is standing behind the counter measuring out rope to some peasants;</l>
<l>Grandmother is cutting a strip of linen for a peasant woman, chaffering with another one at the same time, about the price of a pair of sandals --</l>
<l>And I am sitting there, behind the counter, on a sack of flour,</l>
<l>Playing with my black-eyed little cousin --</l></lg>

<l>When the war was over</l>
<l>Came the young men slowly with an air of being old,</l>
<l>On a morning blue and gold</l>
<l>Through the weed-grown meadow-places</l>
<l>Marched young soldiers with old faces,</l>
<l>Marched the columns of the Emperor with dull, bewildered eyes,</l>
<l>And the day was like a rose upon the skies;</l>
<l>But they feared both light and life,</l>
<l>Feared the aftermath of strife.</l>
<l>Slow they came --</l>

<l>A woman knelt in a garden by the road,</l>
<l rend="indent">Patting a little mound of earth</l>
<l>With aimless hands. Along the highway flowed</l>
<l rend="indent">The gray tide, while the day was at its birth.</l>
<l>She heard the drums, looked up, half smiled:</l>
<l rend="indent">"Why do you march," she said, "and play at soldiers?</l>

<l>There's none to laugh at you -- no little child!</l>

<l rend="indent">Old men grouped by their fright, ran here and there</l>
<l>In startled herds, with shrill unmeaning cries.</l>
<l rend="indent">And there was white in every woman's hair,</l>
<l>And when a window yielded them a face</l>
<l rend="indent">'Twas like a flower blasted by the sun;</l>
<l rend="indent">Children there were none.</l>
<l>The world seemed robbed of joyousness and grace,</l>

<l rend="indent">With hands unearthly slow,</l>
<l>As though her toil must be</l>
<l>The very measure of eternity.</l>
<l>A boy ran from the ranks, stooped, touched her brow;</l>
<l rend="italic">"Margot, Margot! Is it thou?"</l>
<l>She did not glance up at the white-faced lad.</l>
<l rend="indent">Deep in the gray line rang a sudden shout:</l>

<l>Forming toy soldiers into various bands.</l>
<l>A figure in a jeweled diadem,</l>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Shy</hi>, youthful, silent -- and misunderstood</l>
<l>In the white glare of Kinghood thou didst stand.</l>
<l>The sceptre in thy hand</l>
<l>Seemed but a flower the Fates had tossed to thee,</l>
<l>And thou wert called, perchance half-scornfully,</l>
<l>Albert the Good.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>To-day thou standest on a blackened grave,</l>
<l>Thy broken sword still lifted to the skies.</l>
<l>Thy pure and fearless eyes</l>
<l>Gaze into Death's grim visage unappalled</l>
<l>And by the storm-swept nations thou art called Albert the Brave.</l></lg>

<l>Tossed on a blood-red sea of rage and hate</l>
<l>The frenzied world rolls forward to its doom.</l>
<l>But high above the gloom</l>

<l>Albert the good, the brave, the great, thy land</l>
<l>Lies at thy feet, a crushed and morient rose</l>
<l>Trampled and desecrated by thy foes.</l>
<l>One day a greater Belgium will be born,</l>
<l>But what of this dead Belgium wracked and torn?</l>
<l>What of this rose flung out upon the sand?...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold! Afar where sky and waters meet</l>
<l>A white-robed Figure walketh on the sea.</l>
<l>(Peace goes before Him and her face is sweet.)</l>
<l>As once He trod the waves of Galilee</l>
<l>He comes again the tumult sinks to rest,</l>
<l>The stormy waters shine beneath His feet.</l>
<l>He sees the dead rose lying in the sand,</l>
<l>He lifts the dead rose in His holy hand</l>
<l>And lays it at His breast.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>O broken rose of Belgium, thou art blest!</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Grey</hi> broke the light of that Sabbath dawn</l>
<l rend="indent">On the English pickets,</l>
<l>Gold rose the sun o'er the unreaped corn</l>
<l rend="indent">And the Hainault thickets.</l>
<l>Through the park at home, where the young rooks caw'd,</l>
<l>And the dew lay deep on the churchyard sward,</l>
<l>Went Mary, arisen to meet her Lord --</l>
<l>While Mons must be held for England.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Clear broke the day as the bugles blew, --</l>
<l rend="indent">Who shall hear them to-morrow?</l>
<l>Sternly the thunder of Edom grew,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the tally of sorrow.</l>
<l>Right wing, left wing, centre attacked,</l>
<l>Legions launched like a cataract,</l>
<l>But the English stood to their plighted pact, --</l>
<l>Yes, Mons must be held for England!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Pitiless noon, when the screaming shard</l>
<l rend="indent">Left the air acrid.</l>
<l>But they looked on Malplaquet and Oudenarde,</l>
<l rend="indent">So the soil was sacred.</l>
<pb n="57"/>
<l>And they thought (who knows?) on some Surrey lane,</l>
<l>On some mother's kiss, or some school refrain,</l>
<l>And they tightened the girths of their saddles again,</l>
<l>Since Mons must be held for England.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Red set the sun in the angry skies</l>
<l rend="indent">Ere the fight was over.</l>
<l>Fierce were the beams of the cruisers' eyes</l>
<l rend="indent">By the cliffs of Dover.</l>
<l>News -- ill news -- for Namur is lost!</l>
<l>No need for the Eagle to count the cost.</l>
<l>But Mons was the merest hill at the most,</l>
<l>Yet Mons had been held for England.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Lord, Who hast known what a slain Son is,</l>
<l rend="indent">Judge Thou their labor!</l>
<l>Lifted they eyes to the vanities?</l>
<l rend="indent">Deceived their neighbor?</l>
<l>Sift Thou the souls that are utterly Thine,</l>
<l>Clean are those cold hands of covert design;</l>
<l>Silent they lie in their last long line,</l>
<l>Who died to hold Mons for England!</l></lg>

<head rend="center">VISION OF WAR</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<head rend="center">1.</head>
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcap">went</hi> out into the night of quiet stars;</l>
<l>I looked up at the wheeling heavens, at the mysterious firmament;</l>
<l>I thought of the awful distances out there, of the incredible magnitudes, of space and silence and eternity;</l>
<l>I thought of man, his life, his love, his dream;</l>
<l>I thought of his body, how it is born and grows, and of his spirit that cannot be explained.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>All about me slept the land in peace, and nature slept in deep serenity;</l>
<l>An off-shore wind had died at sunset, the bay was calm and golden as twilight fell;</l>
<l>Not a cloud broke the clear and tender blue of the evening sky.</l>
<l>Then the quiet stars came out, the air grew cool with the breath of night;</l>
<l>A land-breeze flurried, wafting the odor of damp woods and late hay-fields;</l>
<l>A gentle breeze, that scarcely turned the sleeping leaves.</l>
<pb n="59"/>
<l>I walked on through the village, I saw the lights go out in houses as men and women prepared for bed;</l>
<l>Safe and secure, the homes of my neighbors rested in the shadow of tall trees, that had been growing there peacefully a long time;</l>
<l>I passed on into the country, crickets were singing in the fields, fireflies were glimmering in the pastures among low growths of spruce and pine;</l>
<l>I mounted a hill, high overhead brooded the majestic and silent heavens;</l>
<l>On the eastern horizon a great bright star arose, casting a track across the bay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I have never seen the world so calm, the air so clear and still;</l>
<l>I have never known an hour so full of quietness.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">2.</head>
<l rend="italic">Hour of the War!</l>
<l rend="italic">Now, now -- and here -- on this same earth, and under this same sky!</l>
<l rend="italic">Now! -- Now! -- The War! -- The War! -- The War!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Night, and a sodden field, and starlight over all,</l>
<l>And on the ground the bodies of dead men lying;</l>
<pb n="60"/>
<l>Tumbled, broken, grotesque, in attitudes unhuman, in lumpish, swollen heaps, they lie,</l>
<l>Where death suddenly snatched them up and flung them down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A strange, dark, silent scene;</l>
<l>Here passed the awful charge three days ago;</l>
<l>Here met the choking volley, shattered out and fell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Three days and nights they have been lying here;</l>
<l>No help could reach them, cast between the battle lines;</l>
<l>No help is needed now.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Slowly above their heads the conflict wore itself away;</l>
<l>Calm settled on the shaking, riven air;</l>
<l>The sharp cries of the wounded stopped one by one, their groans grew fainter;</l>
<l>A few crawled off -- the others lay as they had fallen, under the sun and stars;</l>
<l>Then the third night, and peace at last, the quietness restored.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">3.</head>
<l>Listen! -- could one be living? -- come this way;</l>
<l>Here where a score of bodies are drawn mysteriously together,</l>
<l>A turning face catches a gleam of starlight,</l>
<l>A hand moves, winnowing the air.</l>
<pb n="61"/>
<l><hi rend="italic">"Water!"</hi> -- No use, no use -- too late;</l>
<l>His breast is shot away -- don't move him -- God, how he bled!</l>
<l>What is it, comrade? A letter -- make a light:</l>
<l rend="italic">"We have not heard since you left home.... I cannot bear it...."</l>
<l>Turn the sheet over: -- <hi rend="italic">"Oh, my dear, be careful!"</hi></l>
<l>Here is the signature -- the address -- a distant village;</l>
<l>I have been there -- an ancient, quiet village of the north,</l>
<l>Fronting the open sea.</l>
<l>Yes, comrade, I will write -- he smiles:</l>
<l>To lie here, thinking, suffering, remembering;</l>
<l>To be left to die alone!</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">4.</head>
<l>But not alone:</l>
<l>Passing brother, you have yet a grim companion;</l>
<l>Along the edge of the thicket just now, as I went to the brook down there for water,</l>
<l>I stumbled over something that must have been left from the charge a week ago:</l>
<l>A body that held the remnants of a man.</l>
<l>He had dragged himself to the brook, he lay imbedded in tall waving grass;</l>
<l>His stomach had been ripped open by shrapnel, maggots were heaving in the wound</l>
<pb n="62"/>
<l>(Did you know that a man could live while maggots formed in his flesh?)</l>
<l>His muscles twitched convulsively, he was barely conscious;</l>
<l>He did not notice the match I struck, his eyes were filmed over, he would not drink;</l>
<l>The region that he inhabited was an unknown, unimaginable land.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(At home, a woman waits for news of him:</l>
<l>It is well that she can never hear.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">5.</head>
<l>Pass on, pass on! Behold the mobilization of armies;</l>
<l>The men leaving their work at the counter and factory, dropping the plow where it stands in the field,</l>
<l>Flocking together, filling the towns, saying good-by to wife and children, taking a last look around;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold the flinging forward of nations in the wake of armies;</l>
<l>The marvellous, massive engines, the enormous paraphernalia;</l>
<l>The powerful mechanical conveyances, the long lines of them carrying supplies;</l>
<pb n="63"/>
<l>The immense stores of provisions at the depot, the stacks of clothing and other necessities, the huge piles of fodder and grain for the horses;</l>
<l>The flaring illuminations, the sweating gangs working beneath them, ceaselessly receiving, sorting, distributing;</l>
<l>The field guns, the heavy artillery, their ponderous steady movements through the villages;</l>
<l>The stout-wheeled wagons full of dangerous, costly ammunition;</l>
<l>The roaring trains, arriving and departing, some laden with supplies, some packed with humanity, alive or dead;</l>
<l>The vast and systematic commissariat, the grist of war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">6.</head>
<l>Behold the columns, advancing, advancing, advancing;</l>
<l>Tramping steadily onward, seen behind on the hills, and seen ahead to the distant turn of the road;</l>
<l>Streaming along the valleys, gaining and crossing the passes, flanking the mountain ranges, netting the land with a lethal web;</l>
<l>Accoutrements flashing and jangling, thunder of tread, regular motion swaying and undulating the lines;</l>
<pb n="64"/>
<l>Countless miles of indomitable marching men;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold the front, the million-manned intrenchments, continent-spanning;</l>
<l>The infinite detail of day-works and night-works;</l>
<l>The burrowing, roofing, screening, the placing of barbed-wire entanglements;</l>
<l>The stealthy advance in the darkness, the hasty and desperate digging-in under fire;</l>
<l>The shifting and rushing forward of artillery, the lashing of horses, the running of wires for communication;</l>
<l>The searchlights feeling afar through the night, like cold white fingers;</l>
<l>The life of the trenches, after all is completed;</l>
<l>The hidden underground chambers, the well-concealed passages, the bomb-proof quarters;</l>
<l>The men laughing and singing, some of them making music on simple instruments, some playing cards, some smoking and talking;</l>
<l>Passing backwards and forwards, eating, sleeping, fighting, or taking their leisure, all out of sight, in tunnels and cavities below the surface:</l>
<l>A serious new game for earnest, grown-up children.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Hark, hark! Aloft -- look up;</l>
<l>A great bird sails across the sky, with loud and strident whirr of wings;</l>
<pb n="65"/>
<l>Terribly swift -- a moment -- it is gone.</l>
<l>Can men be passing there on high, so swiftly through the air?)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">7.</head>
<l>Pass on! Behold the charge;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Ready! Run low! Run wide!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l>
<l>Over the open fields, trampling the crops, dropping to fire, rising to run;</l>
<l>(Some never rising, never again to rise;)</l>
<l>Straggling, thinning, wavering, (God, it is hopeless! -- it is too much!)</l>
<l>Onward, onward pressing, rushing and driving onward;</l>
<l>(I did not know that men could be so reckless and brave!)</l>
<l>Mounting the opposite slope, cutting their way through entanglements;</l>
<l>Gaining the outer trenches, (deadly work for the bayonets!)</l>
<l>Shouting, cursing, groaning, stabbing, wrestling, clubbing with butts, fighting at last with bare fists;</l>
<l>Annihilating the enemy, capturing the position!</l>
<l rend="italic">(Victory! Victory! Victory!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l>
<pb n="66"/>
<l>(On the open field lie many huddled shapes;</l>
<l>The wounded are stirring feebly out there, like men awaking from a violent dream;</l>
<l>They lift their heads, they stretch their arms, they struggle to rise on their elbows;</l>
<l>They sit up, staring around -- they crawl like snails among the crops;</l>
<l>A screaming horse dashes athwart the line, dragging his entrails on the ground.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">8.</head>
<l>Behold the ships at sea;</l>
<l>A long and weary time they had been waiting, constantly on the alert, nerves strained to breaking;</l>
<l>In smothering, foggy weather, in gloomy days, in pitch-black nights, in wild and desperate gales;</l>
<l>Anxious for battle, longing to sight the enemy, every one on the lookout, chafing and growling;</l>
<l>Anything, anything, boys, to end this tedious monotony!</l>
<l>(Maybe an unseen deliverer is at hand.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The captain was walking the bridge that morning, the crew were at breakfast, the navigating officer was winding his chronometers;</l>
<l>Suddenly, from forward, a frantic cry! A man runs aft, pointing to windward;</l>
<l>The captain whips out his glasses, scans the horizon;</l>
<pb n="67"/>
<l>For a while, he does not pick up a little white streak on the water, not very far away, drawing rapidly nearer;</l>
<l>A streak like the wake of a shark's fin, cutting along on the weather bow.</l>
<l>He sees it! Quick, to the signal! <hi rend="italic">Stop! Full speed astern!</hi></l>
<l rend="italic">Over, there, with the helm!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Too late, too late, captain of ship and lives;</l>
<l>Away from the little wake springs a broader wake;</l>
<l>A murderous fish drives straight towards you, churning the water as he goes.</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Close compartment doors!</hi> -- the last command;</l>
<l>Then to the end of the bridge, and stand there waiting;</l>
<l>Press tight the lips, fold the arms on the breast, throw back the head:</l>
<l>Below, along the weather rail, a line of men stands silently, watching death come;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A whitish object skims on the surface of the blue sea;</l>
<l>The torpedo strikes below the magazine;</l>
<l>The ship is instantly blown in two -- she sinks like lead;</l>
<l>A faint cheer finds no listener but God.</l>
<pb n="68"/>
<l>A few men struggle on the water, where she went down;</l>
<l>They cling for a while to fragments of wreckage;</l>
<l>There is no help in sight -- they cannot be saved.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Down in the close, tight shell -- in the unseen, mysterious vessel,</l>
<l>Crouching in a dim chamber, in utter silence, wrapped in impenetrable privacy, apart from life, cut off from world of land and sea,</l>
<l>A man sits, breathing hard, clenching his hands;</l>
<l>Far above him, where sunlight strikes on breaking wave, a secret eye looks out,</l>
<l>A secret mirror throws down to him the story there;</l>
<l>One long, intense, absorbing glance -- then to the signal stretches out his hand;</l>
<l>Turning away, as darkly as she came, the submarine speeds homeward,</l>
<l>Leaving the sea to seal her work and bury her dead.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">9.</head>
<l>Behold! Hour of the War!</l>
<l>Life everywhere flowing in strange new channels!</l>
<l>The world aroused, awakened! The silence rent! Peace shattered and overthrown!</l>
<l>The well-ordered conventions rudely broken up! The illusions dissipated! The motives suddenly disclosed!</l>
<pb n="69"/>
<l>Men face to face with nature, death, and pain! The elemental shown! And dim and far, the truth appearing!</l>
<l>The hovering dream I The distant and divine conception!</l>
<l>(I sing no battles lost, retreating armies:</l>
<l>O, I tell you, in this campaign there are no defeats!</l>
<l>O, I tell you, the retreating and advancing armies are equally triumphant!</l>
<l>O, I tell you, the lost battles contribute as much as the battles won, to the sure result of this campaign!</l>
<l rend="italic">Victory! Victory! Victory!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">10.</head>
<l>While about me sleeps the land in peace, while men and women prepare for bed;</l>
<l>While the land-breeze flurries, wafting a scent of autumn woods and fallen leaves;</l>
<l>While the crickets sing in the fields, and fireflies glimmer among low spruce and pine;</l>
<l>While the bright star rises, casting a track across the bay;</l>
<l>While the majestic heavens wheel onward, overlooking space and time;</l>
<l>While the still air drops down its quietness like love.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Satan</hi>? I am.</l>
<l>The Other One? "The Great I am"?</l>
<l>Who knows? Millenniums ago</l>
<l>Some rumor ran that He existed yet!</l>
<l>I half believed it true, as loath to think</l>
<l>That He'd outwitted me, or suffered harm</l>
<l>To rob me of a thrill. Eternity</l>
<l>Is deadly now, I own.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>His name, you say, was God.</l>
<l>As I recall, it was. Priests mumbled it,</l>
<l>And cutthroats bawled it for an oath,</l>
<l>Then, all at once, the priests began to think,</l>
<l>And ceased to pray.</l>
<l>'Twas quite the oddest thing that I have known,</l>
<l>And my dear Foe became thenceforth a myth,</l>
<l>Or faded, like the morning cloud, with man's</l>
<l>Immortal hope (poor Tyndall's, eke, whose word</l>
<l>I'll not forget) into the azure past.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What of my kingdom now?</l>
<l>I have no kingdom now. Long time ago</l>
<l>I tired of kings, as God in His day tired.</l>
<pb n="108"/>
<l>They were too boist'rous in their wickedness,</l>
<l>Too bloody and uncouth. They weren't well bred.</l>
<l>I heard the last of them</l>
<l>Reigned somewhere on the Baltic Sea,</l>
<l>A sodden Hohenzollern prince,</l>
<l>Descended from that self-drunk one</l>
<l>Who made a War -- the only war</l>
<l>That lately I had cared about.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It promised well, but soon went wrong.</l>
<l>Ten million men, yea, twice ten million men,</l>
<l>Swarmed forth to fight for what they called ideals:</l>
<l>From Belgium's mills and mines, from England's marts,</l>
<l>From fairest France and sun-warm Italy,</l>
<l>From Serbia and the Russian steppe, to fight</l>
<l>For Right! Oh God! (old habits rise in me)</l>
<l>For Liberty! They left their little ones,</l>
<l>Their wives, their gold! They flung away their lives</l>
<l>As storms throw pearls of rain. They wearied me!</l>
<l>They were too much like Christ, the crazy one</l>
<l>Who died forgiving all, and took a thief</l>
<l>With him to Paradise.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And so there is no Hel1? I'll not say that.</l>
<l>The name is out of date, but things sometimes</l>
<l>Survive their names, as names so oft live on</l>
<pb n="109"/>
<l>When things and men are dead. There is a land</l>
<l>That once was dedicate to Liberty:</l>
<l>A land that cast off kings and set slaves free.</l>
<l>But when it gathered wealth, and fame, and power,</l>
<l>And could have struck the blow that might have saved</l>
<l>Throughout the world the things for which men died,</l>
<l>The things for which long rows of graves were made,</l>
<l>It would not strike.</l>
<l>It let its own go gurgling down to death,</l>
<l>And did not smite.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Self-made, self-damned, self-governing,</l>
<l>It hammers now, and smelts;</l>
<l>And ever, as it pounds, it sings,</l>
<l>This Tubal Cain -- of Peace!</l>
<l>And golden dollars jingle in the song,</l>
<l>Beneath a sulphuring sky it dwells -- at peace --</l>
<l>In riveless unity of self-content.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I'm growing old? I do not relish quite</l>
<l>The modern way, a Democratic Hell?</l>
<l>I'm growing old? I wonder if I sometimes wish</l>
<l>That God would come again!</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">Dimpling the surface of her babbling streams.</l>
<l>April in England. How the shrapnel screams.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>April in England. Blood and dust and smother,</l>

<l rend="indent">Never again those dewy dawns shall see</l>

<head rend="center">THE NATIONS' DAVID</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Erect</hi> before Hell's hurricane, between the Germans and the sea,</l>
<l>Belgium, still smiling through your pain; still, in the hour of ruin, free;</l>
<l>While yet the cannon's note resounds along each poplar-bordered way,</l>
<l>O, bleeding Belgium, to your wounds what mankind owes what man may say?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Long years, while battle came and went afar at Fate's malign caprice,</l>
<l>Your kindly folk, serene, content, pursued the pleasant ways of peace.</l>
<l>They promised, all the mighty ones: "In that calm land shall not be heard</l>
<l>The thunder of our angry guns" -- Kaiser and King, they pledged their word.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And then, unwarning, arrogant, the cut-throat liar of Berlin</l>
<l>Tore into shreds his covenant: his arm&#x00E8;d hosts were swarming in</l>
<pb n="143"/>
<l>From Prussian beer-halls, Rhinish hills, from Aurich east to Gumbinnen,</l>
<l>From Rostock down to stolen Silz, sounded the tramp of Krupp-made men.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>This was your guardian brother's gift, the choice he gave his little ward:</l>
<l>Betrayal of France (the course of thrift) or (Honor's course) the crimsoned sword.</l>
<l>And you, the Nations' David, chose, while all the world stood trembling by;</l>
<l>You called your sons, and they arose: "Come forth to die! Come forth to die!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Your weaver stopped his whirring loom; as C&#x00E6;sar met him, even so now</l>
<l>Your farmer hurried to his doom, and in its furrow left the plough;</l>
<l>And Flanders, Hainault, Brabant came, Antwerp and Limburg -- all the land:</l>
<l>The nameless and the proud of name, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Not for adventure, nor in pride: with naught to gain and all to lose --</l>
<l>Their homes, their wives, their lives beside -- true sons of you, they, too, could choose.</l>
<pb n="144"/>
<l>They came, with eyes that looked on death; not driven slaves, but conscious men:</l>
<l>The Brugan burgher scant of breath, the lean-limbed hunter of Ardennes.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Their part it was to hold the gate, the narrow gate, against a foe</l>
<l>Outnumbering scores to one -- to wait till Death alone should bid them go.</l>
<l>And how they held it! Man and child; about Li&#x00E8;ge where Leman fed</l>
<l>Blood-hungry Prussians blood and piled the meadows with heroic dead;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>While village after village fell, cottage and church engulfed in smoke;</l>
<l>While all the land became a Hell and served to turn a Teuton joke;</l>
<l>While Belgian women prayed in vain for German mercy, trusting, fond;</l>
<l>While German "Culture" burned Louvain, and German tenderness Termonde:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>You did it, Little Belgium -- you! You stopped the dyke with half your sons;</l>
<l>You did what no one else could do against the Vandals and the Huns!</l>
<pb n="145"/>
<l>The eternal future in your debt from now until Man's latest day,</l>
<l>How can the wondering world forget -- and how, remembering, repay?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>France, Britain, Russia: they have fought as fits the vast initiate;</l>
<l>You, all unready, but unbought, till they were marshalled, held the gate.</l>
<l>Above all clamour and applause, you stand, whatever else befall,</l>
<l>God's David in Mankind's high cause: Belgium, the bravest of them all!</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">With</hi> drooping sail and pennant</l>
<l rend="indent">That never a wind may reach,</l>
<l>They float in sunless waters</l>
<l rend="indent">Beside a sunless beach.</l>
<l>Their mighty masts and funnels</l>
<l rend="indent">Are white as driven snow,</l>
<l>And with a pallid radiance</l>
<l rend="indent">Their ghostly bulwarks glow.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Here is a Spanish galleon</l>
<l rend="indent">That once with gold was gay,</l>
<l>Here is a Roman trireme</l>
<l rend="indent">Whose hues outshone the day.</l>
<l>But Tyrian dyes have faded</l>
<l rend="indent">And prows that once were bright</l>
<l>With rainbow stains wear only</l>
<l rend="indent">Death's livid, dreadful white.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>White as the ice that clove her</l>
<l rend="indent">That unforgotten day,</l>
<l>Among her pallid sisters</l>
<l rend="indent">The Grim <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> lay.</l>
<pb n="152"/>
<l>And through the leagues above her</l>
<l rend="indent">She looked, aghast, and said:</l>
<l>"What is this living ship that comes</l>
<l rend="indent">Where every ship is dead?"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The ghostly vessels trembled</l>
<l rend="indent">From ruined stern to prow;</l>
<l>What was this thing of terror</l>
<l rend="indent">That broke their vigil now?</l>
<l>Down through the startled ocean</l>
<l rend="indent">A mighty vessel came,</l>
<l>Not white, as all dead ships must be,</l>
<l rend="indent">But red, like living flame!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The pale green waves about her</l>
<l rend="indent">Were swiftly, strangely dyed,</l>
<l>By the great scarlet stream that flowed</l>
<l rend="indent">From out her wounded side.</l>
<l>And all her decks were scarlet</l>
<l rend="indent">And all her shattered crew.</l>
<l>She sank among the white ghost ships</l>
<l rend="indent">And stained them through and through.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The grim <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> greeted her</l>
<l rend="indent">"And who art thou?" she said;</l>
<l>"Why dost thou join our ghostly fleet</l>
<l rend="indent">Arrayed in living red?</l>
<l>We are the ships of sorrow</l>
<l rend="indent">Who spend the weary night,</l>
<pb n="153"/>
<l>Until the dawn of Judgment Day,</l>
<l rend="indent">Obscure and still and white."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Nay," said the scarlet visitor,</l>
<l rend="indent">"Though I sink through the sea</l>
<l>A ruined thing that was a ship</l>
<l rend="indent">I sink not as did ye.</l>
<l>For ye met with your destiny</l>
<l rend="indent">By storm or rock or fight,</l>
<l>So through the lagging centuries</l>
<l rend="indent">Ye wear your robes of white.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"But never crashing iceberg</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor honest shot of foe,</l>
<l>Nor hidden reef has sent me</l>
<l rend="indent">The way that I must go.</l>
<l>My wound that stains the waters,</l>
<l rend="indent">My blood that is like flame,</l>
<l>Bear witness to a loathly deed,</l>
<l rend="indent">A deed without a name.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"I went not forth to battle,</l>
<l rend="indent">I carried friendly men,</l>
<l>The children played about my decks,</l>
<l rend="indent">The women sang -- and then --</l>
<l>And then -- the sun blushed scarlet</l>
<l rend="indent">And Heaven hid its face,</l>
<l>The world that God created</l>
<l rend="indent">Became a shameful place!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="154"/>
<l>"My wrong cries out for vengeance,</l>
<l rend="indent">The blow that sent me here</l>
<l>Was aimed in Hell. My dying scream</l>
<l rend="indent">Has reached Jehovah's ear.</l>
<l>Not all the seven oceans</l>
<l rend="indent">Shall wash away the stain;</l>
<l>Upon a brow that wears a crown</l>
<l rend="indent">I am the brand of Cain."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When God's great voice assembles</l>
<l rend="indent">The fleet on Judgment Day,</l>
<l>The ghosts of ruined ships will rise</l>
<l rend="indent">In sea and strait and bay.</l>
<l>Though they have lain for ages</l>
<l rend="indent">Beneath the changeless flood,</l>
<l>They shall be white as silver.</l>
<l rend="indent">But one -- shall be like blood.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcap">walk</hi> down the garden paths,</l>
<l>And all the daffodils</l>
<l>Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.</l>
<l>I walk down the patterned garden paths</l>
<l>In my stiff, brocaded gown.</l>
<l>With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,</l>
<l>I too am a rare</l>
<l>Pattern. As I wander down</l>
<l>The garden paths.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My dress is richly figured,</l>
<l>And the train</l>
<l>Makes a pink and silver stain</l>
<l>On the gravel, and the thrift</l>
<l>Of the borders.</l>
<l>Just a plate of current fashion,</l>
<l>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.</l>
<l>Not a softness anywhere about me,</l>
<l>Only whale-bone and brocade.</l>
<l>And I sink on a seat in the shade</l>
<l>Of a lime tree. For my passion</l>
<l>Wars against the stiff brocade.</l>
<l>The daffodils and squills</l>
<pb n="162"/>
<l>Flutter in the breeze</l>
<l>As they please.</l>
<l>And I weep;</l>
<l>For the lime tree is in blossom</l>
<l>And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And the plashing of waterdrops</l>
<l>In the marble fountain</l>
<l>Comes down the garden paths.</l>
<l>The dripping never stops.</l>
<l>Underneath my stiffened gown</l>
<l>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,</l>
<l>A basin in the midst of hedges grown</l>
<l>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding.</l>
<l>But she guesses he is near,</l>
<l>And the sliding of the water</l>
<l>Seems the stroking of a dear</l>
<l>Hand upon her.</l>
<l>What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!</l>
<l>I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.</l>
<l>All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.</l>
<l>I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,</l>
<l>And he would stumble after</l>
<l>Bewildered by my laughter.</l>
<pb n="163"/>
<l>I should see the sun flashing from his sword hilt and the buckles on his shoes.</l>
<l>I would choose</l>
<l>To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,</l>
<l>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,</l>
<l>Till he caught me in the shade,</l>
<l>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,</l>
<l>Aching, melting, unafraid.</l>
<l>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,</l>
<l>And the plopping of the waterdrops,</l>
<l>All about us in the open afternoon --</l>
<l>I am very like to swoon</l>
<l>With the weight of this brocade,</l>
<l>For the sun sifts through the shade.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Underneath the fallen blossom</l>
<l>In my bosom,</l>
<l>Is a letter I have hid.</l>
<l>It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.</l>
<l>"Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell</l>
<l>Died in action Thursday sen'night."</l>
<l>As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,</l>
<l>The letters squirmed like snakes.</l>
<l>"Any answer, Madam?" said my footman.</l>
<pb n="164"/>
<l>"No," I told him.</l>
<l>"See that the messenger takes some refreshment.</l>
<l>No, no answer."</l>
<l>And I walked into the garden,</l>
<l>Up and down the patterned paths,</l>
<l>In my stiff, correct brocade.</l>
<l>The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,</l>
<l>Each one.</l>
<l>I stood upright too,</l>
<l>Held rigid to the pattern</l>
<l>By the stiffness of my gown.</l>
<l>Up and down I walked,</l>
<l>Up and down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In a month he would have been my husband.</l>
<l>In a month, here, underneath this lime,</l>
<l>We would have broke the pattern;</l>
<l>He for me, and I for him,</l>
<l>He as Colonel, I as Lady,</l>
<l>On this shady seat.</l>
<l>He had a whim</l>
<l>That sunlight carried blessing.</l>
<l>And I answered, "It shall be as you have said."</l>

<l>In Summer and in Winter I shall walk</l>

<l>The patterned garden paths</l>

<l>I shall go</l>
<l>Up and down,</l>

<l>And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcap">stood</hi> to-day high on the Downs</l>
<l>And talked long with a shepherd lad;</l>
<l>I found him pondering by his sheep,</l>
<l>Motionless, staring-eyed, and sad.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But, leaning on his Pyecombe crook --</l>
<l>Long polished by his father's hand --</l>
<l>He told, with slow-tongued eagerness,</l>
<l>This love-tale of his Sussex land:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Me and my mate, Dick, loved a girl,</l>
<l>But he was always down at plough,</l>
<l>And in and out the village, like,</l>
<l>And -- well, he 'listed, anyhow;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"While I bides up here 'long me sheep;</l>
<l>And our girl, though she liked us two</l>
<l>Equal it seemed, she took his ring --</l>
<l>As, sure, she'd right enough to do.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Well, Dick he fought and met his death,</l>
<l>Somewheres in Flanders, so 'tis said;</l>
<l>And I can't go to her, I feels,</l>
<l>Because of Dick there lying dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="170"/>
<l>"They do tell she gets pine and thin,</l>
<l>And mopes and mourns that bitterly,</l>
<l>But I can't go and say a word,</l>
<l>Because he died for her, you see.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"And day by day I sees it more --</l>
<l>I've pieced it all out clear and plain --</l>
<l>As I must go like Dick has gone,</l>
<l>Afore I looks at her again.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Old wall-eyed Bob, there, '11 pine awhile,</l>
<l>And listen, maybe, for my call;</l>
<l>And master, he'll be proper mad,</l>
<l>With lambing coming on, and all.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"But there 'tis, and there ain't two ways:</l>
<l>He went, and 'tis the only thing;</l>
<l>Else I shall grow to hate the hill</l>
<l>And get ashamed o' shepherding.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"That there's her window down below,</l>
<l>Aside the copse, where I could see</l>
<l>(It seems a score o' years agone)</l>
<l>Our girl stand waving up to me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Come Sunday, then, I'll 'list for sure</l>
<l>(The same as you done, Dick, old lad!)</l>
<l>Then, if I gets back, I can go</l>
<l>Fair, like, and face her proud and glad."</l></lg>

<l>We have pined here alone in your splendor;</l>
<l rend="indent">But we speed to your pain lest you fall.</l>
<l>Ask: we give! Is it life or the other?</l>
<l rend="indent">Is it death? Take us whole. We are come</l>
<l>For the sake of our dream of you, Mother,</l>
<l rend="indent">Whose love we have longed for at home!</l></lg>

<l>Oh, Lord of our fathers before us,</l>

<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">He</hi> marched away with a blithe young score of him</l>
<l rend="indent">With the first volunteers,</l>
<l>Clear-eyed and clean and sound to the core of him,</l>
<l rend="indent">Blushing under the cheers.</l>
<l>They were fine, new flags that swung a-flying there,</l>
<l>Oh, the pretty girls he glimpsed a-crying there,</l>
<l rend="indent">Pelting him with pinks and with roses</l>
<l rend="indent">Billy, the Soldier Boy!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Not very clear in the kind young heart of him</l>
<l rend="indent">What the fuss was about,</l>

<l rend="indent">The music drowned his doubt.</l>
<l>It's a fine, brave sight they were a-coming there</l>
<l>To the gay, bold tune they kept a-drumming there,</l>
<l rend="indent">While the boasting fifes shrilled jauntily --</l>
<l rend="indent">Billy, the Soldier Boy!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Soon he is one with the blinding smoke of it --</l>
<l rend="indent">Volley and curse and groan:</l>
<l>Then he has done with the knightly joke of it --</l>
<l rend="indent">It's rending flesh and bone.</l>
<pb n="188"/>

<l>And a warm blood stench that is a-reeking there;</l>
<l rend="indent">He fights like a rat in a corner --</l>
<l rend="indent">Billy, the Soldier Boy!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There he lies now, like a ghoulish score of him,</l>
<l rend="indent">Left on the field for dead:</l>
<l>The ground all around is smeared with the gore of him</l>
<l rend="indent">Even the leaves are red.</l>
<l>The Thing that was Billy lies a-dying there,</l>
<l>Writhing and a-twisting and a-crying there;</l>
<l rend="indent">A sickening sun grins down on him --</l>

<l rend="indent">While life is oozing out:</l>
<l>There are loathsome things he sees a-crawling there;</l>
<l>There are hoarse-voiced crows he hears a-calling there,</l>

<l rend="indent">With all our mother's record-roll of glory,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Great with her greatness, noble with her name,</l>
<l rend="indent">Drank with our mother's milk our mother's story,</l>
<l rend="indent4">And in our veins the splendor of her fame</l>
<l>Made strong our blood and bright;</l>
<l>And to her absent sons her name has been</l>
<l rend="indent">Familiar music heard in distant lands,</l>
<l rend="indent">Heart of our heart, and sinews of our hands,</l>
<l>England, our Mother, our Mistress and our Queen!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Out of the thunderous echoes of the past,</l>
<l rend="indent">Through the gold dust of centuries, we hear</l>
<l rend="indent4">Her voice: "O children of a royal line,</l>
<l rend="indent">Sons of my heart who hold your England dear,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Mine was the past, make ye the future mine</l>
<l>All glorious to the last!"</l>
<l>And, as we hear her, cowards grow to men,</l>
<l rend="indent">And men to heroes, and the voice of fear</l>
<l rend="indent">Is as a whisper in a deaf man's ear</l>
<l>And the dead past is quick in us again.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="194"/>
<l>Her robe is woven of glory and of renown,</l>
<l rend="indent">Hers are the golden laden argosies</l>
<l rend="indent4">And lordship of the wild and watery ways,</l>
<l rend="indent">Her flag is blown across the utmost seas;</l>
<l rend="indent4">Dead nations built her throne and kingdoms blaze</l>
<l>For jewels in her crown.</l>
<l>Her empire like a girdle doth enfold</l>
<l rend="indent">The world; her feet on ancient foes are set;</l>
<l rend="indent">She wears the steel-wrought blood-bright amulet</l>
<l>Wrought by her children in the days of old.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Yet in a treasury of such gems as these,</l>
<l rend="indent">Which power and sovereignty and kingship fill</l>
<l rend="indent4">To the vast limit of the circling sun,</l>
<l rend="indent">England, our Mother, in her heart holds still</l>
<l rend="indent4">As her most precious jewel, save only one,</l>
<l>The priceless pearl of peace --</l>
<l>Peace, plucked from out of the very heart of war</l>
<l rend="indent">Through the long agony of strenuous years,</l>
<l rend="indent">Made pure by blood and sanctified by tears,</l>
<l>A pearl to lie where England's treasures are.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>O peaceful English lanes, all white with may,</l>
<l rend="indent">O English meadows where the grass grows tall,</l>
<l rend="indent4">O red-roofed village, field and farm and fold</l>
<l rend="indent">Where the long shadows of the elm-trees fall</l>
<l rend="indent4">On the wide pastures which the sun calls gold,</l>
<l>And twilight dew calls grey;</l>
<pb n="195"/>
<l>These are the home, the happy cradle place</l>
<l rend="indent">Of every man who has our English tongue,</l>
<l rend="indent">Sprung from those loins from which our sires have sprung,</l>
<l>Heirs of the glory of our mighty race.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Brothers, we hold the pearl of priceless worth,</l>
<l rend="indent">How dare we then to cast our pearl aside?</l>
<l rend="indent4">Is it not more to us than all things are?</l>
<l rend="indent">Nay, peace is precious as the world is wide,</l>
<l rend="indent4">But England's honor is more precious far</l>
<l>Than all the heavens and earth.</l>
<l>Were honor outcast from her supreme place</l>
<l rend="indent">Our pearl of peace no more a pearl would shine,</l>
<l rend="indent">But, trampled under foot of dogs and swine,</l>
<l>Rot in the mire of a deserved disgrace.</l></lg>

<lg>

<head rend="center">(To J. F. R.)</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Two</hi> years ago I taught him Greek,</l>
<l rend="indent">And used to give him hints on bowling:</l>
<l>His classics were a trifle weak;</l>
<l rend="indent">His "action" needed some controlling.</l>
<l>Convinced of my superior <hi rend="italic">nous</hi></l>
<l rend="indent">I thought him crude, and I was rather</l>
<l>Inclined, as master of his House,</l>
<l rend="indent">To treat him like a heavy father.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I wrote the usual reports</l>
<l rend="indent">Upon his "lack of concentration";</l>
<l>Though certainly at winter Sports</l>
<l rend="indent">He did not earn this condemnation.</l>
<l>I took him out San Moritz way</l>
<l rend="indent">One Christmas, and our <hi rend="italic">r&#x00F4;les</hi> inverted,</l>
<l>For in the land of ski and sleigh</l>
<l rend="indent">His mastery was soon asserted.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I thought him just a normal lad,</l>
<l rend="indent">Well-mannered, wholesome, unaffected;</l>
<l>The makings of a Galahad</l>
<l rend="indent">In him I had not yet detected;</l>
<pb n="200"/>
<l>And when I strove to mend his style,</l>
<l rend="indent">Blue-penciling his exercises,</l>
<l>I little guessed that all the while</l>
<l rend="indent">His soul was ripe for high emprises.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Two years ago! and here I am,</l>
<l rend="indent">Rejected as unfit; still trying</l>
<l>(As Verrall taught me on the Cam)</l>
<l rend="indent">To make Greek Plays electrifying.</l>
<l>And he who, till he was eighteen,</l>
<l rend="indent">Found life one long excuse for laughing,</l>
<l>For eighteen solid months has been</l>
<l rend="indent">Continuously "strafed" or "strafing."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He writes me letters from the front</l>
<l rend="indent">Which prove, although he doesn't know it,</l>
<l>That though his words are plain and blunt,</l>
<l rend="indent">He has the vision of a poet;</l>
<l>And lately, on his eight days' rest,</l>
<l rend="indent">After long months of hard campaigning,</l>
<l>He came, and lo! an angel guest</l>
<l rend="indent">I was aware of entertaining.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>About himself he seldom spoke,</l>
<l rend="indent">But often of his widowed mother,</l>
<l>And how she nobly bore the stroke</l>
<l rend="indent">That robbed them of his sailor brother.</l>
<pb n="201"/>
<l>And still, from loyalty or whim,</l>
<l rend="indent">He would defer to my opinion,</l>
<l>Unconscious how I envied him</l>
<l rend="indent">His hard-earned gift of self-dominion.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For he had faced the awful King</l>
<l rend="indent">Of Shadows in the darksome Valley,</l>
<l>And scorned the terrors of his sting</l>
<l rend="indent">In many a perilous storm and sally.</l>
<l>Firm in the faith that never tires</l>
<l rend="indent">Or thinks that man is God-forsaken,</l>
<l>From war's fierce seven-times-heated fires</l>
<l rend="indent">He had emerged unseared, unshaken.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There are, alas! no sons of mine</l>
<l rend="indent">To serve their country in her trial,</l>
<l>Embattled in the cause divine</l>
<l rend="indent">Of sacrifice and self-denial;</l>
<l>But if there were, I could not pray</l>
<l rend="indent">That God might shield them from disaster</l>
<l>More strongly than I plead to-day</l>
<l rend="indent">For this my pupil and my master.</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">A vale once fair to see,</l>
<l>Where under the sweep of the sky's wide arch,</l>
<l>Though winter freeze or summer parch,</l>
<l>The stately poplars march and march,</l>
<l rend="indent">Remembering Lombardy.</l></lg>

<lg>

<l rend="indent">Men of the Saxon heart,</l>
<l>Men of the fens and men of the Peak,</l>
<l>Men of the Kentish meadows sleek,</l>
<l>Men of the Cornwall cove and creek,</l>
<l rend="indent">Men of the Dove and Dart.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Here are men of the kilted clans</l>
<l rend="indent">From the heathery slopes that lie</l>
<l>Where the mists hang gray and the mists hang white,</l>
<l>And the deep lochs brood 'neath the craggy height,</l>
<l>And the curlews scream in the moonless night</l>
<l rend="indent">Over the hills of the Skye.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Here are men of the Celtic breed,</l>
<l rend="indent">Lads of the smile and tear,</l>

<l>From where the loops of the Shannon flow,</l>
<l>And the crosses gleam in the even-glow,</l>

<l rend="indent">And Donegal cliffs are sheer.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And never a word does one man speak,</l>
<l rend="indent">Each in his narrow bed,</l>
<l>For this is the Vale of Long Release,</l>
<l>This is the Vale of the Lasting Peace,</l>
<l>Where wars, and the rumors of wars, shall cease,</l>
<l rend="indent">The valley of the dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>No more are they than the scattered scud,</l>
<l rend="indent">No more than broken reeds,</l>
<l>No more than shards or shattered glass,</l>
<l>Than dust blown down the winds that pass,</l>
<l>Than trampled wefts of pampas-grass</l>
<l rend="indent">When the wild herd stampedes.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In the dusk of death they laid them down</l>
<l rend="indent">With naught of murmuring,</l>
<l>And laughter rings through the House of Mirth</l>
<l>To hear the vaunt of the high of birth,</l>
<l>For what are all the kings of earth</l>
<l rend="indent">Before the one great King!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And what shall these proud war-lords say</l>
<l rend="indent">At foot of His mighty throne?</l>

<l>For there shall dawn a reckoning day,</l>
<l>Or soon or late, come as it may,</l>
<l>When those who gave the sign to slay</l>
<l rend="indent">Shall meet His face alone.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What, think ye, will their penance be</l>
<l rend="indent">Who have wrought this monstrous crime?</l>
<l>What shall whiten their blood-red hands</l>
<l>Of the stains of riven and ravished lands?</l>
<l>How shall they answer God's stern commands</l>
<l rend="indent">At the last assize of Time?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For though we worship no vengeance-god</l>
<l rend="indent">Of madness and of ire,</l>
<l>No Presence grim, with a heart of stone,</l>
<l>Shall they not somehow yet atone?</l>
<l>Shall they not reap as they have sown</l>
<l rend="indent">Of fury and of fire?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>There is a vale in the Flemish land</l>
<l rend="indent">Where the lengthening shadows spread</l>
<l>When day, with crimson sandals shod,</l>
<l>Goes home athwart the mounds of sod</l>
<l>That cry in silence up to God</l>

<l>The one that is really perplexing is known as the Forming of Fours.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Imagine us numbered off from the right: the Sergeant faces the squad,</l>
<l>And says that the odd files do not move -- I never seem to be odd!</l>
<l>And then his instructions run like this (very simple in black and white) --</l>
<l>"A pace to the rear with the left foot, and one to the right with the right."</l></lg>

<l>But as soon as you try to be careful, you get in the deuce of a plight,</l>

<lg>
<l>Besides, when you're thoroughly muddled the Sergeant doubles your doubt</l>
<l>By saying that rules reverse themselves, as soon as you're "turned about";</l>
<l>So round you go on your right heel, and practice until you are deft</l>
<l>At "a pace to the front with the right foot, and one to the left with the left."</l></lg>

<l>Fragrance and beauty come in with the green,</l>
<l>The ragged bushes put on sweet attire,</l>
<l>The birds forget how chill these airs have been,</l>
<l>The clouds bloom out again and move in fire;</l>
<l>Blue is the dawn of day, calm is the lake,</l>
<l>And merry sounds are fitful in the morn;</l>
<l>In covert deep the young blackbirds awake,</l>
<l>They shake their wings and sing upon the morn.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>At springtime of the year you came and swung</l>
<l>Green flags above the newly-greening earth;</l>
<l>Scarce were the leaves unfolded, they were young,</l>
<l>Nor had outgrown the wrinkles of their birth:</l>
<l>Comrades they thought you of their pleasant hour,</l>
<l>They had but glimpsed the sun when they saw you;</l>
<l>They heard your songs e'er birds had singing power,</l>
<l>And drank your blood e'er that they drank the dew.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="248"/>
<l>Then you went down, and then, and as in pain,</l>
<l>The Spring affrighted fled her leafy ways,</l>
<l>The clouds came to the earth in gusty rain,</l>
<l>And no sun shone again for many days:</l>
<l>And day by day they told that one was dead,</l>
<l>And day by day the season mourned for you,</l>
<l>Until that count of woe was finish&#x00E9;d,</l>
<l>And Spring remembered all was yet to do.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>She came with mirth of wind and eager leaf,</l>
<l>With scampering feet and reaching out of wings,</l>
<l>She laughed among the boughs and banished grief,</l>
<l>And cared again for all her baby things;</l>
<l>Leading along the joy that has to be,</l>
<l>Bidding her timid buds think on the May,</l>
<l>And told that Summer comes with victory,</l>
<l>And told the hope that is all creatures' stay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Go, Winter, now unto your own abode,</l>
<l>Your time is done, and Spring is conqueror</l>
<l>Lift up with all your gear and take your road,</l>
<l>For she is here and brings the sun with her:</l>
<l>Now are we resurrected, now are we,</l>
<l>Who lay so long beneath an icy hand,</l>
<l>New-risen into life and liberty,</l>
<l>Because the Spring is come into our land.</l></lg>

<l>In other lands they may,</l>
<l>With public joy or dole along the way,</l>
<l>With pomp and pageantry and loud lament</l>
<l>Of drums and trumpets, and with merriment</l>
<l>Of grateful hearts, lead into rest and sted</l>
<l>The nation's dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>If we had drums and trumpets, if we had</l>
<l>Aught of heroic pitch or accent glad</l>
<l>To honor you as bids tradition old,</l>
<l>With banners flung or draped in mournful fold,</l>
<l>And pacing cortege; these would we not bring</l>
<l>For your last journeying.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We have no drums or trumpets; naught have we</l>
<l>But some green branches taken from a tree,</l>
<l>And flowers that grow at large in mead and vale;</l>
<l>Nothing of choice have we, or of avail</l>
<l>To do you honor as our honor deems,</l>
<l>And as your worth beseems.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Sleep, drums and trumpets, yet a little time;</l>
<l>All ends and all begins, and there is chime</l>
<l>At last where discord was, and joy at last</l>
<l>Where woe wept out her eyes: be not downcast,</l>
<l>Here is prosperity and goodly cheer,</l>
<l>For life does follow death, and death is here.</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">Mixing with dull earth sleep the dead that died</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">Crested with stars and panoplied in light,</l></lg>

<l>Of strenuous clean souls a long array,</l>
<l rend="indent">With lambent lance and white, bright, blinding sword,</l>

<l rend="indent">Bright-eyed, stern-lipped, all day, all night, they go</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">Wind-withered woods, so go they swift and fell,</l>
<l>Warring with principalities and powers,</l>
<l rend="indent">Hunting through space the swart, old bands of Hell;</l></lg>

<l>And all the sounding causeways of the spheres</l>
<l rend="indent">Ring like white iron with the rhythmic tread</l>
<l>Of these and their innumerable peers;</l>

<l>Round England cradled in her roaring seas,</l>
<l rend="indent">With Arctic snows white-girdled, bathed in suns</l>

<l rend="indent">And where one solitary trader runs</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>His English keel, and where one lonely sword</l>
<l rend="indent">Glimmers for England, one unsleeping brain</l>
<l>Watches and works for England, thitherward</l>
<l rend="indent">Gather the bright souls of her servants slain</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For her, and lock their shimmering ranks, and sweep</l>
<l rend="indent">Round England's child as sweeps the northern gale</l>
<l>Round some stark pine-tree on the moorland steep,</l>
<l rend="indent">And from the flash and rattle of their mail</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="258"/>
<l>Hell's pale marauders shudderingly recoil</l>
<l rend="indent">Frustrate. O glad condition and sublime</l>
<l>Of our undying dead, to fight and foil</l>
<l rend="indent">The ancient foe, continually to climb</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Through God's high order of His Saints, to meet</l>
<l rend="indent">Some soul whose star-like name lit all their course,</l>
<l>And commune with him, to discern and greet</l>
<l rend="indent">Old kindred, love, and friendship, hound and horse;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>To see God face to face, and still to see</l>
<l rend="indent">And labor for the loves that grope on earth,</l>
<l>To wait serenely till all souls shall be</l>
<l rend="indent">One in God's aristocracy of worth, --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>O glad condition and sublime! whereto</l>
<l rend="indent">That southern tomb thy hands may never tend</l>
<l>Was but the gateway thy loved boy passed through,</l>
<l rend="indent">Thy wedded love passed through, that he might wend</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Homeward to thee; thou can'st not see the blaze</l>
<l rend="indent">Of his great blade nor hear his trumpets blare,</l>
<l>Yet thick as brown leaves round about thy ways,</l>
<l rend="indent">There go the dead that died for England, there.</l></lg>

<l>Spring -- and the sweet</l>
<l>Laughter of winds at the crossing;</l>
<l>Laughter of birds and a fountain tossing</l>
<l>Its hair in abandoned ecstasies.</l>
<l>Laughter of trees.</l>
<l>Laughter of shop-girls that giggle and blush;</l>
<l>Laugh of the tug-boat's impertinent fife.</l>
<l>Laughter followed by a trembling hush --</l>
<l>Laughter of love, scarce whispered aloud.</l>
<l>Then, stilled by no sacredness or strife,</l>
<l>Laughter that leaps from the crowd;</l>
<l>Seizing the world in a rush.</l>
<l>Laughter of life...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Earth takes deep breaths like a man who had feared he might smother,</l>
<l>Filling his lungs before bursting into a shout....</l>
<l>Windows are opened -- curtains flying out;</l>
<l>Over the wash-lines women call to each other.</l>
<l>And, under the calling, there surges, too clearly to doubt,</l>
<pb n="270"/>
<l>Spring, with the noises</l>
<l>Of shrill, little voices;</l>
<l>Joining in "Tag" and the furious chase</l>
<l>Of "I-spy," "Red Rover" and "Prisoner's Base";</l>
<l>Of the roller-skates whir at the sidewalk's slope,</l>
<l>Of boys playing marbles and girls skipping rope.</l>
<l>And there, down the avenue, behold,</l>
<l>The first true herald of the Spring --</l>
<l>The hand-organ gasping and wheezily murmuring</l>
<l>Its tunes ten-years old....</l>
<l>And the music, trivial and tawdry, has freshness and magical swing.</l>
<l>And over and under it,</l>
<l>During and after --</l>
<l>The laughter</l>
<l>Of Spring!...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And lifted still</l>
<l>With the common thrill,</l>
<l>With the throbbing air, the tingling vapor,</l>
<l>That rose like strong and mingled wines;</l>
<l>I turned to my paper,</l>
<l>And read these lines:</l>
<l rend="italic">"Now that the Spring is here,</l>
<l rend="italic">The war enters its bloodiest phase...</l>
<l rend="italic">The men are impatient....</l>
<l rend="italic">Bad roads, storms and the rigors of the winter</l>
<l rend="italic">Have held back the contending armies....</l>
<pb n="271"/>
<l rend="italic">But the recruits have arrived,</l>
<l rend="italic">And are waiting only the first days of warm weather....</l>
<l rend="italic">There will be terrible fighting along the whole line --</l>
<l rend="italic">Now that Spring has come."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I put the paper down... Something struck out the sun -- something unseen;</l>
<l>Something arose like a dark wave to drown</l>
<l>The golden streets with a sickly green.</l>
<l>Something polluted the blossoming day</l>
<l>With the touch of decay.</l>
<l>The music thinned and died;</l>
<l>People seemed hollow-eyed.</l>
<l>Even the faces of children, where gaiety lingers,</l>
<l>Sagged and drooped like banners about to be furled--</l>
<l>And Silence laid its bony fingers</l>
<l>On the lips of the world...</l>
<l>A grisly quiet with the power to choke;</l>
<l>A quiet that only one thing broke;</l>
<l>One thing alone rose up thereafter...</l>
<l>Laughter!</l>
<l>Laughter of streams running red.</l>
<l>Laughter of evil things in the night;</l>
<l>Vultures carousing over the dead;</l>
<l>Laughter of ghouls.</l>
<l>Chuckling of idiots, cursed with sight.</l>
<l>Laughter of dark and horrible pools.</l>
<pb n="272"/>
<l>Scream of the bullets' rattling mirth,</l>
<l>Sweeping the earth.</l>
<l>Laugh of the cannon's poisonous breath....</l>
<l>And over the shouts and the wreckage and crumbling</l>
<l>The raucous and rumbling</l>
<l>Laughter of death.</l>
<l>Death that arises to sing, --</l>
<l>Hailing the Spring!</l></lg>

<note id="cunliffe142n1" place="foot" n="1" anchored="yes">
<hi rend="smallcap">Author's</hi> <hi rend="smallcap">Note</hi>. -- In the first Battle of Ypres, which was fought in October-November, 1914, a thin line of British, supported on each wing by small bodies of French, stopped the push of an immense German army on Calais. The allusion in the latter part of the poem is not to "the angels of Mons," but to a story received from a very competent witness. On three occasions the Germans broke through our line, then paused and retired, for no apparent reason. On each of these occasions prisoners, when asked the cause of their retirement, replied: "We saw your enormous Reserves." We had no Reserves. This story was incidentally confirmed by the remark of another officer on the curious conduct of the Germans in violently shelling certain empty fields behind our lines.</note>

<l rend="indent14">Merry men of England,</l>

<pb n="291"/>
<l>Where fought the men of England round Ypres in the rain,</l>
<l>On the grim plain of Flanders, whose earth is fed with slaughter.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>North-country fighting men from the mine and the loom,</l>
<l>Highlander and lowlander stood up to death and doom,</l>

<l rend="indent14">London men and Irish,</l>

<l>Leapt from their saddles to charge in fierce disorder,</l>
<l>The Life Guards, mud and blood for the scarlet and the plume,</l>
<l>And they hurled back the foemen as the wind the sea spume,</l>
<l>From Bixschoote to Baecelaere and down to the Lys river.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But the huge Hun masses yet mounted more and more,</l>
<l>Like a giant wave gathering to whelm the sweet shore,</l>
<l>While swift the exultant foam runs on before and over.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="292"/>
<l rend="indent14">Where that foam was leaping,</l>
<l rend="indent14">With bayonets, or with none,</l>

<l rend="indent14">Ran upon the Hun.</l>
<l>The cooks and the service men charged and charged together</l>
<l>Moussy's cuirassiers, on foot, with spur and sabre;</l>
<l>Helmed and shining fought they as warriors fought of yore --</l>
<l>Till calm fell sinister as the hush at the whirlwind's core,</l>
<l>From Bixschoote to Baecelaere and down to the Lys river.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Lo! the Emperor launched on us his guard of old renown,</l>
<l>Stepping in parade-march, as they step through Berlin town,</l>
<l>On the chill road to Gheluveldt, in the dark before the dawning.</l></lg>

<l rend="indent14">Mortal mouths of guns,</l>
<l rend="indent14">Gallantly, gallantly</l>
<l rend="indent14">Came the flower of the Huns.</l>
<l>Proud men they marched, like an avalanche on us falling,</l>
<l>Prouder men they met, in the dark before the dawning.</l>
<pb n="293"/>
<l>Seven to one they came against us to shatter us and drown,</l>
<l>One to seven in the woodland we fought them up and down.</l>
<l>In the sad November woodland, when all the skies were mourning.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The long battle thundered till a waxing moon might wane,</l>
<l>Thrice they broke the exhausted line that held them on the plain,</l>
<l>And thrice like billows they went back, from viewless bounds retiring.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent14">Why paused they and went backward,</l>
<l rend="indent14">With never a foe before</l>
<l rend="indent14">Like a long wave dragging</l>
<l rend="indent14">Down a level shore</l>
<l>Its fierce reluctant surges, that came triumphant storming</l>
<l>The land, and powers invisible drive to its deep returning?</l>
<l>On the grey field of Flanders again and yet again</l>
<l>The Huns beheld the Great Reserves on the old battle-plain,</l>
<l>The blood-red field of Flanders, where all the skies were mourning.</l>
<pb n="294"/>
<l>The fury of their marshalled guns might plough no dreadful lane</l>
<l>Through those Reserves that waited in the ambush of the rain,</l>
<l>On the riven plain of Flanders, where hills of men lay moaning.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent14">They hurled upon an army</l>
<l rend="indent14">The bellowing heart of Hell,</l>
<l rend="indent14">We saw but the meadows</l>
<l rend="indent14">Torn with their shot and shell.</l>
<l>We heard not the march of the succours that were coming,</l>
<l>Their old forgotten bugle-calls, the fifes and the drumming,</l>
<l>But they gathered and they gathered from the graves where they had lain</l>
<l>A hundred years, hundreds of years, on the old battle-plain,</l>
<l>And the young graves of Flanders, all fresh with dews of mourning.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Marlborough's men and Wellington's, the burghers of Courtrai,</l>
<l>The warriors of Plantagenet, King Louis' <hi rend="italic">Gants glac&#x00E9;s</hi> --</l>
<l>And the young, young dead from Mons and the Marne river.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="295"/>
<l rend="indent14">Old heroic fighting men,</l>
<l rend="indent14">Who fought for chivalry,</l>
<l rend="indent14">Men who died for England,</l>
<l rend="indent14">Mother of Liberty.</l>
<l>In the world's dim heart, where the waiting spirits slumber,</l>
<l>Sounded a roar when the walls were rent asunder</l>
<l>That parted Earth from Hell, and summoning them away,</l>
<l>Tremendous trumpets blew, as at the Judgment Day --</l>
<l>And the dead came forth, each to his former banner.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>On the grim field of Flanders, the old battle plain,</l>
<l>Their armies held the iron line round Ypres in the rain,</l>
<l>From Bixschoote to Baecelaere and down to the Lys river.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1"><hi rend="smallcap">Marching</hi> on Tanga, marching the parched plain</l>
<l>Of wavering spear-grass by Pangani river,</l>
<l>England came to me -- me who had always ta'en</l>
<l>But never given before -- England, the giver,</l>
<l>In a vision of tall poplar trees that shiver</l>
<l>On still evenings of summer, after rain,</l>
<l>By Slapton Ley, where reed-beds start and quiver</l>
<l>When scarce a ripple moves the upland grain.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then I thanked God that now I had suffered pain</l>
<l>And, as the parched plain, thirst, and lain awake</l>
<l>Shivering all night through till cold daybreak:</l>
<l>In that I count these sufferings my gain</l>
<l>And her acknowledgment. Nay, more, would fain</l>
<l>Suffer as many more for her sweet sake.</l></lg>
