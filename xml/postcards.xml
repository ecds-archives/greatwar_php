<head>The Kaiser's Dream</head>
<p><text><body><l>There's a story now current, though strange it may seem,</l>
<l>Of the great Kaiser Bill and a wonderful dream.</l>
<l>Being tired of the Allies, he lay down in bed,</l>
<l>And amongst other things he dreamt he was dead.</l>
<l>On leaving the earth to Heaven, he went straight,</l>
<l>Arriving up there, he knocked at the gate,</l>
<l>But St. Peter looked out, and in voice loud and clear,</l>
<l>Said "Begone Kaiser Bill, we don't want you here."</l>
<l>Well, says the Kaiser, that's very uncivil,</l>
<l>I suppose after that, I must go to the Devil?</l>
<l>So he turned on his heel, and off he did go</l>
<l>At the top of his speed to the regions below,</l>
<l>And when he got there he was filled with dismay,</l>
<l>For, while waiting outside, he heard Old Nick say</l>
<l>To his imps: "Now look here, boys, I give you all warning,</l>
<l>I'm expecting the Kaiser down here in the morning;</l>
<l>But don't let him in, for to me its quite clear,</l>
<l>He's a very bad man, and we don't want him here.</l>
<l>If he ever gets in we'll have no end of quarrels,</l>
<l>In fact, I'm aftaid he'll corrupt our good morals."</l>
<l>"Oh, Satan, my dear friend," the Kaiser then cried,</l>
<l>"Excuse me for listening while waiting outside;</l>
<l>If you don't admit me, then where can I go,</l>
<l>Oh do let me in for I'm feeling quite cold.</l>
<l>And if you want money, I've got plenty of gold;</l>
<l>Let me sit in a corner, no matter how hot;"</l>
<l>"No, no," said Old Nickie, "most certainly not;</l>
<l>We do not admit folks for riches and wealth;</l>
<l>Here are sulphur and matches, make a Hell for yourself."</l>
<l>Then he kicked William out, and vanished in smoke,</l>
<l>and just at that moment the Kaiser awoke.</l>
<l>He jumped out of bed in a shivering sweat;</l>
<l>and said, "Well, that dream I shall never forget;</l>
<l>That I won't go to Heaven I know very well,</l>
<l>But it's really too bad to be kicked out of Hell."</l></body></text></p>
