<head rend="center">On Seeing the Coast of England from Boulogne</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">A LONG low line of polished white</l>
<l>Faintly the cliffs of England gleam,</l>
<l>Now slowly fading out of sight,</l>
<l>Now swiftly leaping back, they seem</l>
<l>Strange joys, strange sorrows to impart,</l>
<l>And voices whisper at my heart.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A quiet wood, a quiet lane,</l>
<l>The song of birds amid the trees,</l>
<l>The splash of sun, the sting of rain,</l>
<l>The warm sweet air, the sighing breeze,</l>
<l>And you beside our cottage door</l>
<l>At eventide. Dear heart, once more</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I see the first faint sunbeam tip</l>
<l>The East with gold, the hills light up,</l>
<l>Or stealing lower softly sip</l>
<l>The dewdrop from the rose's cup;</l>
<l>The glint of gorse upon the down,</l>
<l>The long ploughed meadow strong and brown.</l></lg>

<pb n="71"/>
<lg>
<l>We wander 'mid the grassfield where</l>
<l>The busy reaper wends his way,</l>
<l>The sharp scythe flashes on the air,</l>
<l>Heavy the scent of new-mown hay</l>
<l>Floats down the breeze, and all around</l>
<l>The stricken poppies strew the ground.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Slowly my half-felt sorrows go</l>
<l>And hope comes, gazing seaward where</l>
<l>The dim cliffs glitter, for I know</l>
<l>That these and you await me there,</l>
<l>And I shall find them dearer far</l>
<l>Enriched by all the pangs of war.</l></lg>

<l n="1">HOW young and bright he was, and when he laughed</l>
<l>The air around seemed sharing in his joy;</l>
<l>Fair was the world to him, nor spot nor stain</l>
<l>Of all its hidden ugliness had laid</l>
<l>A mark upon his face (that mark that sears</l>
<l>And brands the souls that know it but too well);</l>
<l>But all that's lovely in it lay beneath</l>
<l>The wonder that shone shyly in his eyes.</l>
<l>A child of Nature he, of woods and sunlit ways,</l>
<l>Of rolling meadows where the air was sweet</l>
<pb n="72"/>
<l>With new-born blossoms and the scent of hay;</l>
<l>Of hills and valleys, laughing streams and lakes</l>
<l>Where rustling reeds their whispered secrets told.</l>
<l>All these he knew and loved, they were his friends,</l>
<l>His sole companions, and through them he learnt</l>
<l>To know his mother Nature; all her moods</l>
<l>Diverse and strange he learnt them one by one;</l>
<l>Her summer laughter and her autumn tears,</l>
<l>Her seeming winter harshness and the sweet</l>
<l>Serene repentance of her early spring.</l>
<l>Life was his love, and in her warm soft arms</l>
<l>He freedom found from care, repose and peace,</l>
<l>And finding knew that it sufficed.</l></lg>

<l>And then came War to claim him, dragged him forth,</l>
<l>Forth from his quiet world, and flung him down</l>
<l>Bewildered and amazed, yet unafraid,</l>
<l>The merest cypher in that crowded train.</l>
<l>So hour by hour the meanness of War,</l>
<l>And all its horrors, petty hates and sins</l>
<l>Raged round his struggling head, until the day</l>
<l>A wandering bullet found him, and Death took</l>
<l>Unto himself what Life once held so dear.</l></lg>

<l>His face was smiling when they picked him up</l>
<l>As though he'd learnt his Mother's last great secret</l>
<l>And in learning found all well.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">At a Wayside Shrine</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">THE column halts before a wayside shrine</l>
<l>To change formation into battle line</l>
<l>From double file. 'Tis even, and the sun</l>
<l>Its daily circling race has wellnigh done.</l>
<l>Behind me in the West, a dying glow</l>
<l>Of gold still gleams, to cast a pale halo</l>
<l>Upon the shrine.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent16">How many men before</l>
<l>To-night have halted at this spot, and wore</l>
<l>The same grim, ready look that I see now</l>
<l>Painted on every face from chin to brow,</l>
<l>And in each eye? One and all are ready</l>
<l>For come what may; each man now stands steady</l>
<l>Waiting command.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent16">And now the line will pass</l>
<l>The shrine -- itself as steady as the mass</l>
<l>Of England's sons slow moving to the fray,</l>
<l>Their Destiny now in the hands of -- say,</l>
<l>The dim Divinity within that shrine --</l>
<l>A loving God (the stricken Christ His sign</l>
<l>Of Love) -- or what?</l></lg>

<pb n="78"/>
<lg>
<l rend="indent16">The shrine is rent and drilled</l>
<l>With bullets -- aye, and some of them have killed</l>
<l>Passing right thro' the thin mud walls, and past</l>
<l>The Hanging Figure in the plaster cast,</l>
<l>On to some human target, trudging by,</l>
<l>(Dropping it low with sharp surpriséd cry)</l>
<l>Even as I trudge by.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent16">So have some died</l>
<l>For Right -- bravely as Christ the Crucified</l>
<l>Died on Calvary's Cross; just as brave</l>
<l>And just as sacrificially. To save</l>
<l>The world He died, or so the worn-out creeds</l>
<l>Of Church would teach -- but they, but men, dared deeds</l>
<l>And died as men. ...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent">Because of Greater Love --</l>
<l>That Love of Loves, all other loves above --</l>
<l>The love of Home and Friends and Native Soil.</l>
<l>That these might never be the Foeman's spoil,</l>
<l>They gave their lives, their youth, their gold dreams</l>
<l>And airy castles, built where Sunlight gleams,</l>
<l>And Roses bloom...</l></lg>

<pb n="79"/>
<lg>
<l rend="indent16">And gave them willingly</l>
<l>As Christ gave His, that day on Calvary.</l>
<l>A stricken Christ... a broken shrine... and men</l>
<l>In khaki marching by. ... How little less</l>
<l>Divine these khaki-clads in their worn dress</l>
<l>Than He, the Christ of God? For in each man</l>
<l>The same soul burns.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indent16">And ere I leave the shrine,</l>
<l>I look upon the Christ -- then at the line</l>
<l>Of men... back to His face and those closed eyes</l>
<l>So open when one lingeringly looks</l>
<l>As if into their depths. These men... those eyes...</l>
<l>Loving, pain-haunted eyes, hard gazing down</l>
<l>They seem,</l>
<l>On these -- these other Christs in thin disguise</l>
<l>Of khaki-brown.</l></lg>

And when thou kissest, cling for aye:
For of their band, thou art.

Sounds by Night

I HEAR the dull low thunder of the guns
Beyond the hills that doze uneasily,
A sullen doomful growl that ever runs
From end to end of the heavy freighted sky:
A friend of mine writes, squatted on the floor,
And scrapes by yellow spluttering candle light.
"Ah, hush!" he breathes, and gazes at the door,
That creaks on rusty hinge, in pale affright!
(No words spoke he, nor I, for well we knew
What rueful things these sounds did tell.)
A pause -- I hear the trees sway sighing thro'
The gloom, like dismal moan of hollow knell,
Then out across the dark, and startling me
Bursts forth a laugh, a shout of drunken glee!
<hi rend="smallcaps">France</hi>, 1917.


<pb n="82"/>
Rain

AH! when it rains all day
And the sky is a mist
That creeps by chillily
Where sun once kissed,
Like death pale shroud,
My soul cries out aloud
In hopeless misery.

I cannot read nor write
A line for gloom,
My life lags, drenched of light
To cheer its tomb;
Chill and wet,
Comfortless I fret
In hopeless night!

And naught to hear but rain
Battering the ground!
O numbing pain!
O maddening sound!
Drowned in sky
Trees drip, drip, and sigh
And drip, drip, again!

The Ancient Thought

THE round moon hangs like a yellow lantern in the trees
That lie like lace against the silk blue sky;
O still the night! O hushed the breeze --
Surely God is very nigh.


At the Base

THINK not of me as facing Death,
Tattered, labouring for breath;
Rather think of one who strays
Dreaming dreams by perfumed ways.

Soon I may die, ah, true, 'tis true,
But look! the night is rich with blue
Of peaceful skies, and soft the breeze
Sings in the trembling poplar trees!

And slowly thro' the rustling grass
O'er woodland glade, I, dreaming, pass;
To-morrow? Death? Ah, what are these
But passing childish phantasies!

In Bitterness
TAKE Thou this box,

And more, my heart, bleeding;

Left Alone

LEFT alone among the dying!
All around are moaning, sighing,
Or are cursing, sobbing, crying
In Death's crushing, hushing hand.
We are torn upon the wire,
We are scorched and burnt with fire,
Or lie choking in the mire
Of the star-lit "No Man's Land."

<pb n="85"/>
Hear our prayers, O! gentle Jesus,
Send Thine angels down to ease us
From the pains of Hell that seize us,
From our burning, yearning thirst.
We are broken, we are battered,
Bodies twisted, crushed and shattered
By the shells and bullets scattered
On this strip of land accurst.

Round about are shadows creeping,
Formless Things which wake the sleeping,
Glaring eyes from shell-holes peeping,
Mocking always at our pain.
Cold and wet our limbs are numbing,
Fevered brows are drumming, drumming --
Are the stretchers <hi rend="italic">never</hi> coming?
Are we numbered with the slain?

God in Heaven, canst Thou hear us?
Mary Mother! Dost Thou fear us?
Stretcher-bearers, are you near us?
Give us water or we die!
But a grisly shadow's creeping
With his cruel scythe a-reaping
Weary souls which fall to sleeping
In a choking, croaking sigh.

FRANK C. LEWIS
<hi rend="smallcaps">Flight Sub-Lieut., R.N.A.S.</hi>

Belgium, 1914

I
THE lithe flames flicker through the veil of night,
Licking with bitter tongue; and soon the dawn
Will come, and gaunt and black against the white
Cool sky will loom a smoking home, forlorn
Of all the joy and peace that once was there.
The pleading, pitiful dead lie mute and cold
And all untended still. The fields are bare
Of the young green, the parent of the gold.

O little land, great-hearted, who didst give
Thine all for sake of others' liberty,

<note id="moresongs0n1" place="foot">
Flight Sub-Lieut. Frank C. Lewis, R.N.A.S., was killed in aerial combat in France on August 21st, 1917, aged 19 years. He had only been twelve days in France, being selected for a fighting squadron three days after he landed. His squadron commander described him as having already proved "a brilliant pilot," and of his last air fight that "he fought bravely to a noble end." He fell in our lines and is buried at Bailleul. The Belgium sonnets were written in 1915 while he was a boy at Marlborough.</note>

Knowing the cost, nor shrinking at the thought,
Be sure that thy immortal name shall live
Writ large in thine own ashes. Men shall cry,
"This was a nation marvellously wrought!"

II
There came a voice from out the darkness crying --
A pleading voice, the voice of one in thrall --
"Come, ye who pass -- oh, heed ye not my sighing?
Come and deliver! Hear, oh hear my call!
For when the invader stood before my gate
Demanding passage through with haughty tone,
A voice cried loud, 'Wilt thou endure this fate?
Better have death than live when honour's flown!'
And so my children now lie slain by him
I had not wronged; with strife my land is riven;
Dishonoured here I lie with fettered limb.
To desecration all my shrines are given,
And nought remains but bondage drear and grim. ...
God! Is there any justice under heaven?"


<pb n="88"/>
Ad Profunda

WE have built high walls of pomp and pride
And wealth, around our inmost Being,
And deep, unseen, within there hide
Visions too bright for our dull seeing.

We yearning stand, and cannot pass
To where the Soul with these is One;
Our utterance is as the grass
Withering beneath the noonday sun.

The Waters of Infinity
Break on the spirit's lonely shore
Lo! the wall crumbles, and we see
All we have hoped and striven for.

O, then all time is lost in Time,
The Soul has burst its prison-bars:
We walk with feet still deep in slime,
But with our heads above the stars.

The Downs, looking from Savernake Forest

WITH eager steps I climbed the hill
Ploughed with deep, age-old furrows, till
I reached the forest's edge and gazed
Across the low red town smoke-hazed,
Upon the downs, windy and bare,
Ridge upon ridge unending. There
No sound is heard save only these,
The wind's wild song 'mid lonely trees,
The echo of sheep-bells, and the cry
Of peewits circling in the sky.
Back in the dawn of time on earth,
Before she brought her sons to birth,
You stood the same as now you stand --
Untroubled, vast, majestic, grand:
Only you had not heard the tramp,
Old Hackpen Hill and Barbury Camp,
Of many an army passing by
Under a blue and cloud-flecked sky.
And happy they who fell in fight
Upon your clear and wind-swept height:
With thunder for their requiem
And the dark clouds to weep for them,
<pb n="90"/>
They dream the centuries away
Through changeless night and changeless day.

O Downs, I think it good that you
Have given your secret to the few
Who love you and can understand.
You are not as this other land
Trodden by all who chance to pass:
Only we tread your close-cropped grass
Who love to feel the beat of rain
Washing away all town-born pain:
Wind: and the heights whence one may see
The littleness of man: and we
There feel at last that we are free.
