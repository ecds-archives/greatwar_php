<lg>
<l>Soft benediction of September sun;</l>
<l>Voices of children, laughing as they run;</l>
<l>Green English lawns, bright flowers and butterflies;</l>
<l>And over all the blue embracing skies.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>THERE</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Tumult and roaring of the incessant gun;</l>
<l>Dead men and dying, trenches lost and won;</l>
<l>Blood, mud, and havoc, bugles, shoutings, cries;</l>
<l>And over all the blue embracing skies.</l></lg>

<head rend="center">KART&Uacute;SHKIYA-BER&Oacute;ZA</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I<hi rend="smallcaps">t</hi> is twelve years since I have been there --</head>
<head rend="center">I was born there,</l>
<l>In the little town, by the river --</l>
<l>It all comes back to me now</l>
<l>Reading in the newspaper:</l>
<l rend="italic">"The Germans have seized the bridge-head at Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za;</l>
<l>The Russians are retreating in good order across the marshes;</l>
<l>The town is in flames."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l>
<l>Sweet-sounding, time-scented name --</l>
<l>Smelling of wide-extending marshes of hay;</l>
<l>Smelling of cornfields;</l>
<l>Smelling of apple-orchards;</l>
<l>Smelling of cherry-trees in full blossom;</l>
<l>Smelling of all the pleasant recollections of my childhood --</l>
<l>Smelling of Grandmother's kitchen,</l>
<l>Grandmother's freshly-baked dainties,</l>
<l>Grandmother's plum-pudding --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="33"/>
<l>I see before me a lane running between two rows of straggling cottages --</l>
<l>I cannot remember the name of the lane;</l>
<l>I do not know whether it has any name at all;</l>
<l>But I remember it was broad and unpaven and shaded with wide-branching chestnuts --</l>
<l>And enters the market-place</l>
<l>Just a few houses after my Grandfather's --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see it even now</l>
<l>My Grandfather's house --</l>
<l>On the lane, to the right, as you come from the market-place;</l>
<l>A big, hospitable frame building --</l>
<l>Big like my Grandfather's own heart,</l>
<l>And hospitable like Grandmother's smile --</l>
<l>I can see it even now,</l>
<l>With the white-pillared porch in the centre and the sharp-gabled roof</l>
<l>Pierced with little windows;</l>
<l>And the great quadrangular garden behind it;</l>
<l>And the tall fence surrounding the garden;</l>
<l>And the old well in the corner of the garden;</l>
<l>With the bucket-lift</l>
<l>Rising over the fence --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="34"/>
<l>I can see him even now,</l>
<l>My Grandfather --</l>
<l>Bending over me, tall and sad-eyed and thoughtful</l>
<l>Lifting me up and seating me on his knees</l>
<l>Lovingly,</l>
<l>And listening to all my childish questions and confessions;</l>
<l>Pardoning, admonishing, remonstrating --</l>
<l>Satisfying my interrogative soul with good-humored indulgence --</l>
<l>And my Grandmother,</l>
<l>Dear little woman!</l>
<l>I can never dissociate her from plum-pudding and apple dumplings,</l>
<l>And raisin-cakes and almond cakes and crisp potato pancakes</l>
<l>And the smell of fish frying on the fire --</l>
<l>And then there is my cousin, Miriam,</l>
<l>Who lived in the yellow house across the lane --</l>
<l>A freckle-faced, cherry-eyed little girl with a puckered-up nose.</l>
<l>I was very romantic about her;</l>
<l>And then there is my curse, my rival at school, my arch-enemy --</l>
<l>Jacob,</l>
<l>The synagogue sexton's boy,</l>
<l>On whom 1 was always warring --</l>
<pb n="35"/>
<l>God knows on what battlefield he must be lying now!</l>
<l>And then there is Nathan and Joseph and Berel and Solomon</l>
<l>And Ephraim, the baker's boy,</l>
<l>And Baruch and Gershen and Mendel</l>
<l>And long-legged, sandy-haired Emanuel who fell into the pond with me that time,</l>
<l>While we were skating on the ice --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I can see myself even now</l>
<l>In the lane on a summer's day,</l>
<l>Cap in hand, chasing after dragon-flies --</l>
<l>Suddenly, near by, sounds the noise of drums and bugles --</l>
<l>I know what that means!</l>
<l>Breathlessly I dash up the lane --</l>
<l>It is the regiment quartered in the barracks at the end of the town, in its annual parade on the highway --</l>
<l>How I would wish to be one of those gray-coated heroes!</l>
<l>I watch them eager-eyed --</l>
<l>And run after them until they reach the Gentile Quarter --</l>
<l>And then I turn back --</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="36"/>
<l>I am in the market-place --</l>
<l>At a Fair;</l>
<l>The market-place is a heaving mass of carts and horses and oxen;</l>
<l>The oxen are lowing, the horses are neighing, the peasants are cursing in a dozen different dialects --</l>
<l>I am in Grandfather's store,</l>
<l>On the lower end of the market-place, right opposite the public well --</l>
<l>The store is full of peasants and peasant women, bargaining at the top of their voices;</l>
<l>The men are clad in rough sheepskin coats and fur caps;</l>
<l>The women are gay in bright-colored cottons and wear red kerchiefs around their heads;</l>
<l>My Grandfather is standing behind the counter measuring out rope to some peasants;</l>
<l>Grandmother is cutting a strip of linen for a peasant woman, chaffering with another one at the same time, about the price of a pair of sandals --</l>
<l>And I am sitting there, behind the counter, on a sack of flour,</l>
<l>Playing with my black-eyed little cousin --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l>
<l>Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za!</l>
<l>It comes back to me suddenly --</l>
<pb n="37"/>
<l>That I am sitting here, with a newspaper in my hand,</l>
<l>Reading:</l>
<l rend="italic">"The Germans have seized the bridge-head at Kart&uacute;shkiya-Ber&oacute;za;</l>
<l rend="italic">The Russians are retreating in good order across the marshes;</l>
<l rend="italic">The town is in flames!"</l></lg>

<l n="1">Y<hi rend="smallcaps">es</hi>, he is gone, there is the message, see!</head>
<head rend="center">Slain by a Prussian bullet as he led</l>
<l>The men that loved him -- dying, cheered them on --</l>
<l>My son, my eldest son. So be it, God!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>This is no time for tears, no time to mourn,</l>
<l>No time for sombre draperies of woe.</l>
<l>Let the aggressors weep! for they have sinned</l>
<l>The sin of Satan. Lust of power and pride,</l>
<l>Mean envy of their neighbors' weal, a plot</l>
<l>Hatched amidst glozing smiles and prate of peace</l>
<l>Through the false years; until the Day, the Day</l>
<l>When all this worship at the Devil's feet</l>
<l>Should win the world. Ay, let them weep!</l>
<l rend="indent44">But we</l>
<l>With eyes undimmed march on; our mourning robes</l>
<l>Be-jewelled by the deeds of those that die,</l>
<l>Lustre on lustre, till no sable patch</l>
<l>Peeps through their brilliance.</l>
<l rend="indent33">In the years to come,</l>
<l>When we have done our work, and God's own peace,</l>
<pb n="40"/>
<l>The Peace of Justice, Mercy, Righteousness,</l>
<l>Like the still radiance of a summer's dawn,</l>
<l>With tranquil glory floods a troubled world;</l>
<l>Why then, perhaps, in the old hall at home,</l>
<l>Where once I dreamed my eldest-born should stand</l>
<l>The master, as I stand the master now,</l>
<l>Our eyes, my wife, shall meet and gleam, and mark</l>
<l>Niched on the walls in sanctity of pride,</l>
<l>Hal's sword, Dick's medal, and the cross he won</l>
<l>Yet never wore. That is the time for tears,</l>
<l>Drawn from a well of love deep down; deep down,</l>
<l>Deep as the mystery of immortal souls,</l>
<l>That is the time for tears; not now, not now!</l></lg>

<head rend="center">THE RETURN</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">H<hi rend="smallcaps">ome</hi> across the clover</head>
<head rend="center">When the war was over</l>
<l>Came the young men slowly with an air of being old,</l>
<l>On a morning blue and gold</l>
<l>Through the weed-grown meadow-places</l>
<l>Marched young soldiers with old faces,</l>
<l>Marched the columns of the Emperor with dull, bewildered eyes,</l>
<l>And the day was like a rose upon the skies;</l>
<l>But they feared both light and life,</l>
<l>Feared the aftermath of strife.</l>
<l>Slow they came --</l>
<l rend="indent">Now that it was over --</l>
<l>Silent and sick and lame,</l>
<l rend="indent">Home across the clover.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A woman knelt in a garden by the road,</l>
<l rend="indent">Patting a little mound of earth</l>
<l>With aimless hands. Along the highway flowed</l>
<l rend="indent">The gray tide, while the day was at its birth.</l>
<l>She heard the drums, looked up, half smiled:</l>
<l rend="indent">"Why do you march," she said, "and play at soldiers?</l>
<pb n="42"/>
<l>There's none to laugh at you -- no little child!</l>
<l rend="indent">Not one. They've all gone back to sleeping."</l>
<l rend="indent">She fell to awful weeping.</l>
<l rend="indent">"Why do you play at soldiers?"</l>
<l>Then dropped down</l>
<l>To pat the little grave. The line went on and on into the town.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They saw it first in the city's eyes,</l>
<l rend="indent">Old men grouped by their fright, ran here and there</l>
<l>In startled herds, with shrill unmeaning cries.</l>
<l rend="indent">And there was white in every woman's hair,</l>
<l>And when a window yielded them a face</l>
<l rend="indent">'Twas like a flower blasted by the sun;</l>
<l rend="indent">Children there were none.</l>
<l>The world seemed robbed of joyousness and grace,</l>
<l rend="indent">A young girl with a head of snow</l>
<l>Sat weaving garlands in the market-place</l>
<l rend="indent">With hands unearthly slow,</l>
<l>As though her toil must be</l>
<l>The very measure of eternity.</l>
<l>A boy ran from the ranks, stooped, touched her brow;</l>
<l rend="italic">"Margot, Margot! Is it thou?"</l>
<l>She did not glance up at the white-faced lad.</l>
<l rend="indent">Deep in the gray line rang a sudden shout:</l>
<l rend="italic">"They're mad! They're mad !"</l>
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">"Silence, you dogs, until you're mustered out.</hi></l>
<l rend="italic">Forward, to greet the Emperor."</l>
<pb n="43"/>
<l rend="indent29">The line</l>
<l>Wavered and moaned and stumbled through the town</l>
<l rend="indent">Like some dark serpent with a broken spine.</l>
<l>Before the palace gate, in cloak and crown,</l>
<l>A shriveled figure sat with shaking hands,</l>
<l>Forming toy soldiers into various bands.</l>
<l>A figure in a jeweled diadem,</l>
<l rend="indent">Who, as the swords leaped with a ringing noise,</l>
<l>Lifted his wasted eyes and looked at them.</l>
<l rend="indent">"Ah !" said the Emperor, and smiled:</l>
<l rend="indent4">"More toys!"</l></lg>
