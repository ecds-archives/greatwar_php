<l>Alway, the nobleness that England gives</l>

<head rend="center">The Dawn Patrol</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">SOMETIMES I fly at dawn above the sea,</l></l>
<l>Where, underneath, the restless waters flow -</l>
<l rend="indent">Silver, and cold, and slow.</l>
<l>Dim in the east there burns a new-born sun,</l>
<l>Whose rosy gleams along the ripples run,</l>
<l rend="indent">Save where the mist droops low,</l>
<l>Hiding the level loneliness from me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now appears beneath the milk-white haze</l>
<l>A little fleet of anchored ships, which lie</l>
<l rend="indent">In clustered company,</l>
<l>And seem as they are yet fast bound by sleep,</l>
<l>Although the day has long begun to peep,</l>
<l rend="indent">With red-inflam&egrave;d eye,</l>
<l>Along the still, deserted ocean ways.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The fresh, cold wind of dawn blows on my face</l>
<l>As in the sun's raw heart I swiftly fly,</l>
<l rend="indent">And watch the seas glide by.</l>
<pb n="17"/>
<l>Scarce human seem I, moving through the skies,</l>
<l>And far removed from warlike enterprise --</l>
<l rend="indent">Like some great gull on high</l>
<l>Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then do I feel with God quite, quite alone,</l>
<l>High in the virgin morn, so white and still,</l>
<l rend="indent">And free from human ill:</l>
<l>My prayers transcend my feeble earth-bound plaints --</l>
<l>As though I sang among the happy Saints</l>
<l rend="indent">With many a holy thrill --</l>
<l>As though the glowing sun were God's bright Throne.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My flight is done. I cross the line of foam</l>
<l>That breaks around a town of grey and red,</l>
<l rend="indent">Whose streets and squares lie dead</l>
<l>Beneath the silent dawn -- then am I proud</l>
<l>That England's peace to guard I am allowed;</l>
<l rend="indent">Then bow my humble head,</l>
<l>In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.</l></lg>

<l n="1">SHALL God forget these darkling years we spend</l>
<l>In poverty and misery and toil</l>
<l>Unlit save by a glint of fa&euml;ry spoil</l>

<l>The darkling years when only Hope is friend</l>
<l>To Courage who, from where our foes embroil,</l>
<l>Still calls us onward -- onward tho' the soil</l>

<l>The spoken word holds true: the swords we wield</l>
<l>Upended show the Cross that, potent yet,</l>
<l>Shall prove each wound we suffer on the field</l>
<l>No sacrifice made vainly to abet</l>
<l>A senseless purpose. Wait but for the yield</l>

<head rend="center">The Harvest</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">SHADOWLESS lies the land</l>
<l>Under the sun,</l>
<l>Only the poplars stand</l>
<l>With moveless boughs in the heat</l>
<l>That broods o'er the blackened wheat</l>
<l>And the ground so hardly won.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>No other tree in the waste.</l>
<l>They only stand</l>
<l>Where the straight white road is traced</l>
<l>Athwart the land.</l>
<l>And ever under the sky</l>
<l>Do the slow-winged birds go by --</l>
<l>The slow black birds of prey</l>
<l>That wait but the close of day</l>
<l>For the night to bring them food.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The curse of the heat is here,</l>
<l>And the curse of blood.</l>
<l>Cold-lipped, and with eyes of fear,</l>
<l>'Neath the sun's flood</l>
<pb n="22"/>
<l>Wanders the spirit of death;</l>
<l>And e'en in the burning noon is an icy breath</l>
<l>And the red of the west is to me like the redness of blood.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The village is still as the heat,</l>
<l>From the ruined houses start</l>
<l>The rats across the street. --</l>
<l>There is never another sound,</l>
<l>For the guns are silent to-day,</l>
<l>And the endless lines of men that are bound</l>
<l>For the place of death and the nameless mound</l>
<l>Have taken another way.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>At the end of the ruined street</l>
<l>Roodless the church yet stands</l>
<l>To the God men praise with their lips</l>
<l>While they mock Him with their hands;</l>
<l>With hands that have scrawled for sport</l>
<l>Their jests on the altar-stone,</l>
<l>And their ribald words on the lips of Christ,</l>
<l>The marred Christ hanging alone.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Who has measured pain,</l>
<l>And who has a plumb for that sea</l>
<l>Where the soul shall know again</l>
<l>Its own immensity?</l>
<pb n="23"/>
<l>For the voice of the mind is dumb,</l>
<l>But the voice of the soul is heard,</l>
<l>Where the wild dark waters are come</l>
<l>And the face of man's sky is blurred.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Who shall say "Lo here</l>
<l>Shall the glory of war be found,</l>
<l>That a nation arose without fear</l>
<l>And smote her foe to the ground</l>
<l>For the wrong that he dared to dream,</l>
<l>And the hell that he wrought on earth;</l>
<l>That she pressed after Honour's gleam</l>
<l>Though it led to a land of dearth"?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Who has measured wrong,</l>
<l>And who shall assign it a bond?</l>
<l>Where the scornful might of the strong</l>
<l>And the cry of the weak be found --</l>
<l>Say, is the tale complete?</l>
<l>Ah! myriad wrongs spring up</l>
<l>Where one has set its feet,</l>
<l>And the earth is a poisoned cup</l>
<l>Where the goodly wine brings death,</l>
<l>And one drop of venom there</l>
<l>Shall poison the very breath</l>
<l>Of the winds in the upper air.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What of the men who died</l>
<l>Stout-hearted and steadfast-eyed</l>
<l>For the good they might not share</l>
<l>And the goal to them denied?</l>
<l>For the lamp they strove to bear</l>
<l>Should light another's way,</l>
<l>And the boon that they might not share</l>
<l>Is the boon we hold to-day.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What of the god-like men</l>
<l>Who lie in the dust to-day</l>
<l>For the dreams that we hold so light</l>
<l>And the hope that we fling away?</l>
<l>Ah! shall we not vex their sleep,</l>
<l>We men of the lesser mould,</l>
<l>Who sully the name they bled to keep,</l>
<l>And the honour they died to hold?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A thousand ages ago</l>
<l>Man fought with the axe of stone</l>
<l>That the many might seize the thing they loved</l>
<l>From the few, and hold it alone.</l>
<l>For the will of the strong was law</l>
<l>And the right of the weak was death</l>
<l>When man was one with the beasts of the earth</l>
<l>And battled with them for breath.</l></lg>

<pb n="25"/>
<lg>
<l>And to-day with their coward lips</l>
<l>Men prate of love in their creeds,</l>
<l>And a thousand times today</l>
<l>Do they spurn her with their deeds.</l>
<l>For we talk of the law of truth</l>
<l>While our God is the law of might,</l>
<l>And the will of the strongest there</l>
<l>Is the thing we hold as right.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What have we gained with the years,</l>
<l>But the greater power to lie?</l>
<l>We, who speak of the truth,</l>
<l>Smooth-voiced and with side-long eye;</l>
<l>Better the axe of stone</l>
<l>And the feet on the weakest throat</l>
<l>Than the lying lips and the coward thrust</l>
<l>And the stealthy eyes that gloat.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now for the one's desire</l>
<l>Shall the many be crucified</l>
<l>On the cross of a lawless power</l>
<l>With the nails of a soulless pride.</l>
<l>And the wrong goes deeper yet,</l>
<l>Aye, deep as the springs of life,</l>
<l>And has blossomed out at the 'hest of pride</l>
<l>In the deadly flower of strife.</l></lg>

<pb n="26"/>
<lg>
<l>And nothing shall purge the land</l>
<l>Where the curse of sin has stood</l>
<l>But the purge of the whetted steel</l>
<l>And the drench of blood.</l>
<l>While perchance at the end shall Peace</l>
<l>Her impotent pinions spread</l>
<l>O'er the ruined home and the smoking land</l>
<l>And the blank eyes of our dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Hark! -- through the lazy air</l>
<l>Comes the sound of guns again.</l>
<l>Once more man reaps with a sickle of fire</l>
<l>The harvest of the slain.</l></lg>
