<head type="sub">EWART  ALAN   MACKINTOSH</head>

<p>THE only surviving son of the late Alexander Mackintosh, formerly of Teaninich House, Alness, Ross-shire, Alan Mackintosh was born on 4th March 1893 at Brighton. He was the grandson of Dr Guinness Rogers. He received his early education at Brighton College, from which he won a scholarship at St Paul's, going straight into the Middle VIIIth. He was already a writer of verses, and for a period he edited the <hi rend="italic">Pauline</hi>. Two years later, in October 1912, he came to Christ Church as a Classical Scholar. At Christmas 1914 he joined the 5th Seaforths as a subaltern, and after training at Golspie he crossed to France with his battalion in July 1915, and bore his share of fighting. In May 1916 he carried out a successful raid, which was described in the Press at the time, and which brought him the Military Cross. He returned to England in August 1916, having been wounded and gassed at High Wood.For eight months he taught bombing to the corps of cadets


<pb n="4   MEMOIR"/>

at Cambridge ; and while at Cambridge he became engaged to Sylvia Marsh, daughter of a Quaker family, with whose traditions and ideals he had much in common. They planned to make their home in New Zealand. In October last he returned to France, joining the 4th Battalion of the Seaforths, and on 21st November, in the fighting about Cambrai, he fell,shot through the head.</p>

<p>Alan Mackintosh looked the Gael he was, loose-limbed,muscular, tall and dark. He carried a fine head well. His roving eye, merry, tender, cautious, penetrating, bold by rapid turns, epitomised the richness of his nature and his still rarer force of self-expression.</p>

<p>He spent two happy years at Oxford. For study, and especially the routine study of the schools, he cared little. Native power and a felicitous exuberance in literary things gained him his place in honour classical moderations. He played with Socialism, to the point of having scruples about the possession of wealth. He read poetry enthusiastically, and notably French poetry, in which his <hi rend="italic">r&#x00E9;pertoire</hi> was very large. Both in term and out of term he cultivated, above all, the sentiments and the arts of the Highlands. He learned to play the pipes and to speak Gaelic, things which later endeared him to his regiment. His friendships were many and ardent. Of


<pb n="MEMOIR  5"/>

his bosom friends, Andrew Fraser of Christ Church was reported wounded and missing in the same Cambrai fighting,E. J. Solomon of Exeter College, who is commemorated in " Gold Braid," was killed in August 1917, while Ian M'Kenzie of Balliol has fallen in the present battle.</p>

<p>In the army the Gael in him, artist and man, ripened quickly. With growing strength and health he grew in the control and the use of his own powers and in influence over other men. He cherished political ambitions, whether to be fulfilled in the Colony or in England he scarcely knew. As a soldier he united brilliant courage with gentleness, and humour with resolution.His vivid and affectionate nature remained undulled through the years of warfare.</p>

<p>The present volume contains a number of pieces, some early and some late, which the author, had he lived, might have omitted. His many friends, and those who will know him only through his two books, will alike feel that from a last volume as little as need be should be excluded. It is difficult for one who knew him very intimately to estimate his work, for in each poem the author's personality speaks with engaging and engrossing clearness. There is much in this volume and in " A Highland Regiment" (1917) that is already peculiarly complete and rounded in idea and also finished in form.   There


<pb n="6  MEMOIR"/>

is much, too, of great promise. " The Remembered Gods," which was written at Oxford, shows his poetic power with the great spaces, the long-ranging time, the brooding significance which are as a home to the highland imagination. In this direction, perhaps, his work might have developed notably. The shorter pieces exhibit remarkable concentration of mood and mastery of technique. The keynote varies : here the lightest play of fancy, there the broadly comic, again a haunting pain, sentiment, reverie, grimness, and unforced irony, but everywhere melody and sure movement and a delicate rightness. The   war  pieces,   unlike   many   that  have   been written since 1914, evade the circumstance and horror of war.There is strangely little, indeed, about the war in any of them,but much about the minds and hearts of those who wage it. There shines through them a very triumph over war. This much loved gallant poet is of those whose living martyrdom rises whole-souled above the storm of violence and is humanity's true victory.   And not that martyrdom only.</p>

<head>WAR, THE LIBERATOR<lb/>
(TO THE AUTHORESS OF "NON-COMBATANTS")</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>SURELY War is vile to you, you who can but know of it,</l>
<l>Broken men and broken hearts, and boys too young to die,</l>
<l>You that never knew its joy, never felt the glow of it,</l>
<l>Valour and the pride of men, soaring to the sky.</l>
<l>Death's a fearful thing to you, terrible in suddenness,</l>
<l>Lips that will not laugh again, tongues that will not sing,</l>
<l>You that have not ever seen their sudden life of happiness,</l>
<l>The moment they looked down on death, a cowed and beaten thing.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Say what life would theirs have been, that it should make you weep for them,</l>
<l>A small grey world imprisoning the wings of their desire ?</l>
<l>Happier than they could tell who knew not life would keep for them</l>
<l>Fragments of the high Romance, the old Heroic fire.</l>


<pb n="14 WAR THE LIBERATOR"/>

<l>All they dreamed of childishly, bravery and fame for them,</l>
<l>Charges at the cannon's mouth, enemies they slew,</l>
<l>Bright across the waking world their romances came for them,</l>
<l>Is not life a little price when our dreams come true ?</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>All the terrors of the night, doubts and thoughts tormenting us</l>
<l>Boy-minds painting quiveringly the awful face of fear.</l>
<l>These are gone for ever now, truth is come contenting us,</l>
<l>Night with all its tricks is gone and our eyes are clear.</l>
<l>Now in all the time to come, memory will cover us,</l>
<l>Trenches that we did not lose, charges that we made,</l>
<l>Since a voice, when first we heard shells go shrilling over us,</l>
<l>Said within us, " This is Death--and I am not afraid ! "</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Since we felt our spirits tower, smiling and contemptuous,</l>
<l>O'er the little frightened things, running to and fro,</l>
<l>Looked on Death and saw a slave blustering and presumptuous,</l>
<l>Daring vainly still to bring Man his master low.</l>
<l>Though we knew that at the last, he would have his lust of us,</l>
<l>Carelessly we braved his might, felt and knew not why</l>
<l>Something stronger than ourselves, moving in the dust of us,</l>
<l>Something in the Soul of Man still too great to die.</l></lg>

<l>The rose-tree flung across your way.</l>
<l>And with the perfect sight of you</l>
<l>The blossom took a braver hue,</l>
<l>And sucked your wisdom like the dew,</l>
<l>Your beauty like a summer shower.</l>
<l>Never before was any flower</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>TIME was when squatting in a noisome ditch,</l>
<l>I used to while away monotonous days</l>
<l>By writing many doggerel lyrics, which</l>
<l>Were set to various untuneful lays,</l>
<l>And the rude soldiery who heard them sung</l>
<l>In billets, when we rested from the fight,</l>
<l>Picked up the words from me, and then gave tongue</l>
<l>Waking with discord all the quiet night,</l>
<l>And sang them, thinking it tremendous fun,</l>
<l>Unto the musical and writhing Hun.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>And I've been told, and can believe it true,</l>
<l>That once, as they intoned these songs of mine,</l>
<l>The Germans heard and trembled, for they knew</l>
<l>What men were these who came into the line,</l>
<l>And sent a message to our Colonel,</l>




<pb n="86  THE BALEFUL BARD"/>

<l>Saying the thing was worse than what the Tanks were ;</l>
<l>He answered, begging them to go to Hell.</l>
<l>And thus we took that village on the Ancre</l>

<l>Or dictionary to find a proper rhyme.)</l></lg>

<l>And now sequestered in this quiet nook,</l>
<l>I struggle to instruct the wise Cadet</l>
<l>In bombing (not according to the book)</l>
<l>Patrols and how most surely to revet</l>
<l>The crumbling trenches on the local hill,</l>
<l>And oft to the jocund piano's strain,</l>
<l>I mount upon the platform with a will</l>
<l>To sing those ancient songs of mine again,</l>
<l>And place, obedient to my country's call,</l>
<l>A deadlier strafer in their hands than all.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>For these young officers shall find the pote</l>
<l>A weapon to avenge the nation's wrongs,</l>
<l>And they with many a discordant note</l>
<l>Shall chant in many a trench my poignant songs ;</l>
<l>And the pale enemy (to whom I fear</l>
<l>For the rhyme's sake I must refer as " Hunes ")</l>


<pb n="THE BALEFUL BARD  87"/>

<l>Shall tremble in their deep dug-outs to hear</l>
<l>Across the night those wild untuneful tunes,</l>
<l>And shall beseech their officers and cry,</l>
<l>" Let us retire at once, or else we die."</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>But lo, there comes a yet more dreadful day,</l>
<l>When with his pleasant months of Blighty o'er,</l>
<l>The bard shall lift his pack and hie away</l>
<l>To land again upon the Gallic shore,</l>
<l>And set his ribald muse to work anew,</l>
<l>And fresh atrocities shall vex the Huns,</l>
<l>And men shall sing them as they used to do</l>
<l>The while from Bosche to Bosche the whisper runs</l>
<l>Down the whole line from Belgium to Champagne,</l>

<l>IN that remembered and unpleasant spot,</l>
<l>Where 'twas my task to haunt the barricade,</l>
<l>To hurl the bomb and give it to you hot</l>
<l>For every little tiny sound you made.</l>
<l>Oh, Basil, when at first your bombs returned,</l>
<l>Our martial spirits quickened and we burned</l>
<l>To land you one--the very batmen yearned</l>
<l>For that decease of yours too long delayed.</l></lg>

<l>We carried out that raid upon your line,</l>

<l>That we should send you rapidly to hell.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>But now that I am far from war's alarms</l>
<l>I like to muse upon the years to come</l>

 will alike be dumb,</l>

<head>A RAID</head>

<p>"PARTY, 'shun !   Left-tum !   You will parade again at 2.15 in full equipment.   Party, dis-miss ! "</p>

<p>The fifty big men turned to their right, slapped their rifles,and broke off by twos and threes towards their billet. As they went in, one splendid-looking boy of nineteen or twenty seized a friend by the waist and brought him down after a short struggle.</p>

<p>"You look out, De Wet," said his Sergeant, an English Highlander, " or you'll be too tired to get at the Germans."</p>

<p>The boy looked up, flashing a smile at him.</p>

<p>" Tired ? I'll no get tired," he said, " this is chust ma trainin'," and followed the rest into the billet.</p>

<p>Their two officers stood watching them as they went.</p>

<p>" My God, Charles," said the Senior Subaltern, " aren't they great ? God help any Bosche that meets those lads. They're just as fit and happy as they can be. I feel top-hole, too, don't you ?   I don't see that there's anything can spoil it."</p>




<pb n="122  A RAID"/>

<p>The other spoke slowly, looking in front of him.</p>

<p>" Oh, I'm not in the least afraid of anything, if we can only get into the trench," he said.    " If the wire's cut         "</p>

<p>" Oh, damn the wire," said the Senior Subaltern hotly "it can't help being cut. Anyhow, there's very little there to start with, and if there's any bombardment at all, it'll go west; and there's going to be a hell of a bombardment. Anyhow, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can't do any more.    Come on in and feed."</p>

<p>For the last week the two had been down in the village with their fifty men, training hard for a raid on the German salient opposite their line. A fortnight's hard reconnoitring night after night had let them know all that could be known about the ground, and the week had been mostly spent in bayonet fighting and bombing, and generally in making them, as the Senior Subaltern put it, " fit to waltz through hell and back again." But all the time their two officers had before them one dread--the spectre of the uncut wire. They were both experienced soldiers and knew what it meant--and now, as they went into luncheon, each saw a vision of his splendid men struggling in the meshes, and heard the rattle of a ghostly machine-gun. At luncheon they managed to forget their fear for a little, and the Senior Subaltern, a light-hearted person entertained the Quartermaster, Transport Officer, and Padre


<pb n="A RAID  123"/>



with whom they messed, by a vivid and heartrending description of the painful scene which would take place as his mangled corpse was borne down the line, and their unavailing regrets that they had not been kinder to him when he was a bright, happy boy, Charles MacRae, his junior, was more serious, but both of them felt curiously as if the whole raid was just a game of unreality, and at the last moment they would hear that it was " let us pretend," Particularly did they feel this when, after luncheon, they paid their servants the arrears.The Senior Subaltern's batman refused to take the money; to which his officer replied: " You've jolly well got to. I'm not going to have you rifling my pockets for it after I'm dead."From which it may be seen that he was a particularly cheerful pessimist.</p>
<p>At 2.15 the pontoon waggons, which the sappers had lent the party, arrived, and the men piled on to them laden, some with rifle and bayonet, some with spiked knobkerries, and all with bombs. Their officers climbed on to the leading waggon, and the cavalcade started, looking, as MacRae said, like a football crowd. All the troops they met looked at them with respect, guessing their mission, and everybody felt no end of a fine fellow, quite forgetting the imminent danger which caused the respect.   The only thing they seemed to be


<pb n="124  A RAID"/>


nervous of was falling off the waggons. As they drove past a redoubt some way behind the reserve line, Charles MacRae spoke, " That's fine wire," he said. " You wouldn't get through that easily," " Oh," said his Senior, " that's back wire. You won't get anything like that in a front line," But the nightmare had gripped them again, and both were silent until they dismounted from their waggons and started to file up the communication trench, when the babble of talk died down among the men too, and the only sound was the heavy breathing of an apoplectic Sergeant.</p>

<p>" I'm sorry hurrying you, Sergeant Dunnet," said the Senior Subaltern, " but we've got to be at Battalion Head¬quarters at 5, although I don't suppose zero'll be for a good time after that."</p>

<p>Zero, it must be explained, is the time of the raid. In the orders it had been stated, " The artillery will barrage at X. 20. The infantry will advance at X. 25." What time X, was, would not be given out until they reached Battalion H.Q. Hence the uncertainty of the Senior Subaltern and his hurry.</p>

<p>The battalion was lying in the reserve trench near Brigade H.Q. As they moved along the trench comrades came out of their dug-outs into the sunlight to wish them good luck, and from the Coy. Mess to which the two officers belonged


<pb n="A RAID  125"/>


came shouts of " Tagg ! " (the Senior Subaltern's name was MacTaggart).</p>

<p>" Hullo, John," replied that perspiring individual. " Hullo, A Coy."</p>

<p>" When are you going over, Tagg ? " inquired his Captain.</p>

<p>" I don't know. Probably not for a good while, but we've got to be at H.Q. at 5."</p>

<p>" Well, come and have tea with us. We've got fresh salmon. Just come out.   The Major's coming, and David."</p>

<p>" Right Ho ! I will, but I must buzz along now or the C.O.'ll be wanting to know why the devil I'm late."</p>

<p>At Battalion H.Q. he stopped and saluted his C.O., who was leaning against the parados with the Major and the Adjutant.</p>

<p>" Here he is," said the Colonel. " How are you feeling, MacTaggart ? "</p>

<p>" Very hot, sir," said MacTaggart with fervour, wiping his brow, " I could do with some tea fine."</p>

<p>" Come and have it with us," said the C.O. " You've plenty of time.   X. isn't till 8."</p>

<p>" Oh, good," said MacTaggart. " Do you hear that, Charles ? Three hours we've got. When shall I tell the men to fall in again, sir ? "</p>



<pb n="126 A RAID"/>

<p>" Seven will do," said the CO. " But what have you done to yourself ? I've never seen you look so smart. Is that a new tunic ? "</p>

<p>" Well, sir," said MacTaggart with a grin, " I thought I might as well get killed like a gentleman."</p>

<p>" You are a gruesome young devil," said the Adjutant. " Are you coming to tea at Headquarters ? "</p>

<p>" Well, as a matter of fact we've got a previous invitation coupled with a salmon from A Coy," replied the graceless youth, " and unless you've anything better."</p>

<p>" Oh, get along," said the C.O.    " Have you got a watch yet ? "</p>

<p>" No, sir, I'm borrowing David Sutherland's." And the raiding party dispersed each to a dug-out to feed at other people's expense.</p>

<p>During tea the fear which had possessed the two officers left them, and a pleasant tranquillity based on the reflexion that it couldn't be helped took its place ; but the sensation of unreality was very strong as they sat in the dug-out with their friends just as they had done a hundred times ; only now they were going over the top in two hours' time. At last at seven they girded on their weapons, and stumbled up the dug-out steps.</p>


<pb n="A RAID 127"/>



<p>" Good-bye, old things," said MacTaggart at the top, " no doubt I shall see you again some time to-night."</p>

<p>" Good-bye, Tagg," floated up a voice from below. " Will you have lilies or roses ? "</p>

<p>" No flowers by request," was the retort, and the O.C raid proceeded to Headquarters where his party was already assembled, and their grey-haired Brigadier, himself a Highlander and veteran of three wars, was waiting to speak to them before they went out. His speech was a short and simple one characteristic of the man, " You're going to help make the name of the regiment, and the fame of the North, to-night, men. I've heard that in Flanders yesterday the Bosche came up against Scotsmen again, and got the worst of it. Now, you'll show 'em to-day that Scotsmen can give them the worst of it here, too. Scotland for ever. Lead on, Mr MacTaggart, and good luck," and the raiding party filed up the long communication trench to the front line.</p>

<p>The spring evening was quiet and still, with hardly a cloud to ruffle the sky, and birds here and there were singing as the party tramped on. Overhead came the drone of a British aeroplane, but nowhere was there a sound of shelling. It was the quietest evening any of them had seen on that battered front; only they knew that soon its tranquillity would be torn


<pb n="128 A RAID"/>



with the rushing of a thousand shells through the air, and all the imminent hell into which they must charge to meet what secret foes awaited them hidden in the deep and silent trench.</p>

<p>" Good luck, sir." " Good luck, boys ! " N.C.O.'s and men of their battalion stood at attention as they passed up, and a lump came into the Senior Subaltern's throat. Suppose he had lost his nerve. Suppose that when the time came he should not have the courage to give the signal to advance. Savagely he fought his doubts, reminding himself of past risks lightly taken, heartening himself with a phrase he had heard the men use, " they cannae kill our officer," and partially succeeded. But the abysmal doubt persisted somewhere in his brain, as it had done always before action, and probably always would.</p>

<p>At the support trench he parted from Charles MacRae, who was to advance from another crater. " See you in half an hour, Charlie," he said, and went on to the front line with his half of the party. A sister battalion of the regiment was garrisoning the front line, and as he went up he passed officers he knew. He hurried his party a bit, feeling unreasonably that they would be too late into the crater, and as they went up the narrow trench leading to it there was a metallic roar


<pb n="A RAID  129"/>

from the German trench 80 yards away.   The men ducked instinctively.</p>

<p>"Trench mortar," said one. "Terrible short, though. There goes another," and craned his neck up to watch the burst.</p>

<p>His officer turned on him savagely, " Keep down, you damned fool," he said.    " Do you want to give us away ? "</p>

<p>Three fears began to obsess him. Perhaps the Germans would retaliate and drop one on to his close-packed party; perhaps the bloody fools had showed themselves already and given the raid away.</p>

<p>" Oh, God," he whispered, " don't let us get casualties before we start the show."</p>

<p>The other fear was caught from the men. All along the line the whisper was running, " Short, they're droppin' short an' missin' the trench."</p>

<p>" You fools," he whispered back, " that's going for the wire, not the trench," and reassured them; but all the same, he felt it himself.   The bursts seemed short, even for the wire.</p>

<p>Now they had come to the first crater from which a tunnel had been made to the second. " Fix bayonets," he whispered, "and keep low."</p>

<p>One by one they slipped into the crater while their officer



<pb n="130 A RAID"/>


cursed them softly for not keeping low, or making a row. Then through the tunnel, and lying down below the lip he looked at his watch.    Ten minutes too soon.</p>

<p>" We've plenty of time, boys," he whispered, " I'll give you the word to get ready."</p>

<p>The men composed themselves to wait in easy attitudes, but each had some nervous trick betraying his tense condition.Some licked their dry lips again and again, some felt their bayonets. One red-haired fellow took out all his bombs, one by one, and squeezed their pins pensively. The enemy trench mortars were replying on our trench now, and the usual evening bombardment was going on. A new fear took possession of the Senior Subaltern. He looked at his watch. There would be a hitch in the timing ; the barrage would be late, and they would have to go over without it. He watched the seconds go by. Only one minute, only half a minute, to the start of the barrage.</p>

<p>Swish--bang--bang--bang. The whole earth was convulsed with a tornado of sound, as the roar of the bursting shells in the German line convinced the Senior Subaltern that all was well. The men in the crater pressed their faces to the ground that was shaking beneath them, trying to hide themselves from that terrible crashing, but their officer's heart


<pb n="A RAID 131"/>

sang^ within him. It was all right. It was properly timed. He' glanced at his watch, and nudged the men on each side of him.</p>

<p>" Pass along, ' Three minutes to go, get ready,' " he yelled--no need to whisper now--and into his mind came a picture of his boat on the Isis on a sunny day, and the coach on the bank counting the seconds to the starting gun. He laughed at the queer similarity.</p>

<p>" Half a minute more," he passed along, and watched the seconds ticking past. Then all at once he climbed up, and, for a second or two, stood alone on the crater lip. " Come along, boys," he said quietly, and the raiding party poured after him out across the open.</p>

<p>As he ran across the shell-torn No Man's Land a strange exultation came over him. It was the same ground that he had crawled through painfully night after night, but seen in the daylight it was different and very thrilling. But what a devil of a long way it was--much farther than he had thought. Where was the damned trench ? Surely it wasn't so far as all that.</p>

<p>Suddenly it yawned before him, and he saw at his feet a few scattered posts, and some strands of broken wire. A huge relief took possession of him, as he threw away his wire-cutters,


<pb n="132  A RAID"/>

shouting, " Come along, boys ! The bloody wire's cut," and plunged forward to the trench.</p>

<p>Wide and deep and empty it lay at his feet, and he forgot all about bayonets and bombs and Germans, thinking only how he could get down without falling flat on his face. He climbed down gingerly from sandbag to sandbag, and turned to the left with his revolver ready, full of disappointment and fear that the Bosche had evacuated.</p>

<p>Round the traverse was one of his men looking at a hole under the parapet. He stood and stared too, wondering stupidly what the devil it could be. " It's a dug-out," said the man's voice from very far away, and suddenly he was aware of a bullet hitting the side of the trench, and four Bosches stumbling up the dug-out steps, and shouting as they came. All at once his brain began to act rapidly. He yelled inarticulate curses, and pulled out a bomb from his haversack.The pin came out easily, but the Germans were too close.He dropped the lever and held the thing for a second or two ;then flung it at the climbing men and leapt side-ways. There was a sharp crash as the bomb burst, and he sprang back again with his revolver ready. Writhing on the dug-out steps lay three of the Germans. The fourth leaned against the side with his hands over his face. A savage joy possessed the

<pb n="A RAID  133"/>

Senior Subaltern, and he shoved his revolver close to the man's face and fired. Those clutching hands dropped, and the German crashed to the steps with the back of his head blown away.</p>

<p>" Bomb down there," yelled MacTaggart to the men who had gathered outside, and tore on to the left to meet MacRae's party at the point of the salient. Still there was not a German in the trench, and the M.G. emplacement at the point stood empty with the mouth of a dug-out below it. Up the trench towards him came a stream of running men, and he had nearly fired when he saw that they were kilted, and Charles MacRae was at the head. He turned to bomb the big dug-out. From below came a shout, " You bastards ! You English bastards."</p>

<p>" English be ------! " yelled a man behind him hoarsely, Scotch, you ------ liars," and a bomb shot down the stair.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of the shouting and the explosions, he had time to laugh at that.</p>

<p>As he stood watching them bombing he suddenly became aware of one of his own men from the right coming towards him at a sort of staggering run. Blood was streaming down the man's face and neck, and then MacTaggart saw one of the most terrible sights in the world, fear in the eyes of a brave man.</p>

<pb n="134  A RAID"/>

<p>" I'm wounded, sir," the man gasped as he ran.</p>

<p>The words steadied MacTaggart.</p>

<p>" All right," he said clearly.  " That's the way home."</p>

<p>The man climbed painfully out and vanished.</p>

<p>Down the trench slowly came the red-haired man who had fingered his bombs in the crater. He was weaponless now, and his hands clutched at the sides of the trench as he came on, bleeding and wild-eyed.</p>

<p>" I'm wounded, sir, I'm wounded," he groaned.</p>

<p>"All right, out you go," said his officer. "What was it?"</p>

<p>" Our own ------ shells," cried the man, his voice rising to a scream, and he, too, disappeared.</p>

<p>Now a great knot of wounded and panic-struck men came down, and MacTaggart thought " We're done. They've properly caught us. No matter. We killed a good few in those two dug-outs anyway."   And gave the signal to retire.</p>

<p>From both sides the men streamed past and out, their officers watching them as they went. One wounded man came limping up, and stood feebly hesitating.</p>

<p>" Oh, get to hell out of this," yelled the Senior Subaltern, and half-kicked, half-pushed him on to the parapet. Two sappers brought up land mines and laid them one in the dug-out, and


<pb n="A RAID  135"/>

one in the emplacement. Then they scrambled out, and the two officers prepared to follow.</p>

<p>"Sir!   Sir!"</p>

<p>MacTaggart turned. It was his English Sergeant, Godstone, no longer immaculate, but dishevelled and wild-eyed. The Sergeant saluted.</p>

<p>" I've three men along here with their legs off," he said.</p>

<p>In a flash MacTaggart saw the two possibilities before him. The men were certain to die, and it was pretty certain death for himself and the other two to go back, " Just chucking away extra lives," he thought, and suddenly found life very desirable. For a second he hesitated. Then he remembered a score of things--his promise that he wouldn't go back and leave one of them alive in the German trench, his pride that the men had always trusted him and followed him, his affection for the men, and, above all, the eternal principle, as old as war, " An officer can't desert his men." He turned to Charlie MacRae, suddenly calm, " Will you watch the left," he said; " Sergeant Godstone and I will bring these fellows along."</p>

<p>The impassive MacRae climbed on to the parapet, and sat there with his revolver in his right hand and a bomb in his left.    He, too, like MacTaggart, knew that the odds were a


<pb n="136  A RAID"/>

thousand to one against them, but he made no remark. As MacTaggart turned back at the corner of the traverse he felt strangely comforted by the sight of MacRae sitting solidly there with his eyes fixed on the trench.</p>

<p>Along the trench the two ran past dug-outs from which came sounds of moanings, and suddenly came on the three men lying in a blood-stained bay with their rifles and bombs littering the ground. The first looked up at them as they bent over him. It was the boy who had wrestled with his chum in the morning. His legs were off below the thigh, and he looked strangely shrunken. " I'm done for, Sergeant," he said steadily, " you take the others."</p>

<p>The next man lay screaming, " Oh, my legs, my legs." They lifted him and dragged him along the trench, cursing. The Senior Subaltern was filled with unreasonable anger against the man for being so heavy and making such a filthy row.</p>

<p>" Oh, <hi rend="italic">come</hi> on, you silly devil," he said, with a pull which made the man scream ; then " Oh, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> sorry, Thompson.No matter.    You'll be home soon."</p>

<p>As they dragged him to the point of exit they saw MacRae still sitting impassive, looking down the trench to the left. The Sergeant climbed up, and between them they lifted the groaning man up the twelve-foot parapet.</p>


<pb n="A RAID  137"/>

<p>Sergeant Godstone dragged him to a shell-hole, and MacTaggart went back for the others. He was alone now, and the queer comfort which the Sergeant's presence had given him was withdrawn. He looked fearfully at each dug-out door, expecting to see a German bayonet emerging. By the time he had got to the men again he felt weak and hopeless. He fingered his pistol, thinking, " One shot for me and one for each of the men.    They won't get any prisoners."</p>

<p>At his feet a wounded man looked up piteously.</p>

<p>" Ma airm an' ma leg's off," he cried, full of his own pain, " Ma airm an' ma leg's off." MacTaggart felt that the chap would have appealed just the same to a Prussian for sympathy. A great pity flooded his mind, mixed again with wild anger at the man for giving him all this trouble.</p>

<p>" Oh, you silly devil," he shouted in a high unnatural voice, " can't you crawl on your other leg and arm ? "</p>

<p>The man groaned.    " Turn me over, sir, and I'll try."</p>

<p>There was a noise of feet and guttural voices along the trench beyond, MacTaggart tore a bomb from his bag and threw it over the traverse. Screams followed the burst and feet running rapidly away.</p>

<p>A man slipped down from the parapet above him. " I heard ye were left behind,   sir,"   he   said,   conversationally,  and



<pb n="138  A  RAID"/>

MacTaggart turned to see his own bombing Sergeant, come back for him through the No Man's Land again. Suddenly he felt " This is all right. I'm going to get through. We're all going to get through. And isn't wee Macdonald a damned fine chap to come back for me like that ? "</p>

<p>" Come on, Macdonald," he cried, and together they dragged the man to the point, and rolled him up on to the parapet.</p>

<p>Once again they went back for the boy. His brown eyes were dull now, but he whispered, " You clear out, sir, I'm done."</p>

<p>" Rot," said his officer, and up to the point they dragged him and tried to lift the dead weight to the top.</p>

<p>All at once MacTaggart's strength seemed to leave him, and his arms were powerless to move the heavy body.</p>

<p>" Oh, God ! I can't shift him," he gasped. " Charlie, come and help."</p>

<p>Charlie MacRae set his arms to the work, and his senior staggered into the open to drag MacNeil, the man with the pulped leg and arm, into an old trench, which ran down to their own line. The German guns were bursting shrapnel all along their parapet now, but he did not notice except in a curious, unthinking way, as if his mind was dulled to danger.He was filled with a hysterical rage against the Germans for


<pb n="A RAID  139"/>

hurting his men, and, as he lugged the groaning MacNeil into the slight cover of the old trench, with an artistic delight in the thing he was doing, he seemed to be regarding himself from the front stalls, of a gigantic theatre and applauding a fine piece of acting. He wouldn't get through it, and nobody would know, but he was doing the right thing, and painting a good picture. The aesthetic joy of it buoyed him up as he helped Sergeant Godstone along with the other man ; then went back to the parapet where Charles and Sergeant Macdonald were still struggling with the boy. He looked down at the shrunken face.</p>

<p>" I believe we'll have to leave him, Charles," he said, " he's a dying man."</p>

<p>Charlie MacRae looked up with his hand on the boy's heart.</p>

<p>" No, he isn't," he said; " he's dead."</p>

<p>They rose and left him lying there on the German parapet; from the right as they ran for the old trench, came the clatter of a machine-gun.</p>

<p>The next few minutes seemed to MacTaggart interminable hours filled with the bursting of shells and the shrieks of the wounded men, as he pulled them along. Now he was lugging at one, now at the other, and now running back with Macdonald, screaming hysterical curses, to throw bombs into the Bosche



<pb n="140 A RAID"/>

trench. There was one moment of terror when their two land mines went up, and another, when Macdonald shouted " They're coming, sir," and he ran back, firing his revolver at grey figures that he fancied were looming through the smoke.
One of the wounded men, a Catholic, began to confess his sins as they dragged him along. Once Sergeant Godstone prayed for strength to get them in, and MacTaggart heard himself crying, " Oh, God, let's get these poor devils in, and give those swine hell, and I don't care what happens." Then there was a terrible time when only Godstone and he seemed to be left; he ran down to our line to look for stretcher-bearers, and found two men sitting in a hole.</p>

<p>" Come on, you bloody cowards," he yelled, " and help us in with the wounded.</p>

<p>" We're wounded ourselves, Tagg," said Charles MacRae.</p>

<p>" Oh, it's all right, Charlie," he shouted back, " we'll get them in all right." But back MacRae and Macdonald came to help them in.</p>

<p>And now at the mouth of our sap were stretcher-bearers to give them a hand, and wire half-cut, easy to get through for whole men, but making the wounded scream with pain; while in the broken hole crouched MacTaggart telling the rest to get in and he would cover their retreat, till suddenly


<pb n="A RAID  141"/>

British shrapnel cloaked the German line, and for five minutes our own machine-guns screamed over his head. Then, all at once, the tumult stopped dead, and in the stillness there came from the German salient a single flare.    The raid was over.</p>

<p>With the end of danger MacTaggart broke down and sobbed, crying for " My men, my beautiful men," and then turning to the German line with a scream, "You swine, I'll give you hell for this." A hand fell on his arm. It was his dear Major," Father " to the whole brigade.</p>

<p>" What's up, Tagg ? " said the Major.</p>

<p>" I'm going back to give those swine hell, Major," he yelled, and was knocked sideways by a vigorous clout on the head.</p>

<p>" You young fool," said the Major, " what you want is a drink," and led him down to H.Q., where his men were already assembled. First of all, he went to the dressing station, and found there men lying and sitting, to hear from one that he had bayoneted two Germans, from another that he had bombed such dug-outs, and to realize that the raid had really succeeded, although it was a while before they found how well.</p>

<p>At H.Q. was Sergeant Godstone sitting on the steps with his head in his hands--it was from his section that the dead had come. The C.O. gave them both strong whiskies, and brought in Charles MacRae for another.   Then they went to Brigade


<pb n="142  A RAID"/>

H.Q., to receive the thanks of the Brigadier, and lastly, jolted off, he and Godstone together, in a mess-cart back to the village again.</p>

<p>At the end of the village a waiting piper struck up " Highland Laddie."</p>

<p>" Damn you, shut up," shouted MacTaggart to him. " That's not the way I feel."</p>

<p>Stiffly he dismounted from the cart, and saying good-night to his men, walked slowly up the hill to the billet, where he and Charles had stayed together.</p>

<p>Their landlady came to the door crying, " Mais o&#x00F9; est l'autre officier ? "</p>

<p>" II est bless&#x00E9;, Madame," said MacTaggart heavily, " mais nous avons tu&#x00E9; plus que quarante Bosches--et je suis tres fatigu&#x00E9;."</p>

<head>IN THE WOOD</head>

<p>THE sun struck through the still unriven trees upon earth, baked by a month of drying suns and torn into fantastic heaps and hollows by the hands of men and the burst of shells; for the wood had been the centre of a ten-days' struggle, and either side had hurled earth-shaking crumps into it, and had dug frantically little slit trenches to hide themselves from the death which was menaced by every whining shell. Now at last it was British, and save for a commodious dug-out here and there, and some torn grey equipment, no trace was left of the German occupation. The tall trees stood up parched and blasted by the hot breath of the explosions or lay where the explosions had struck them down; the fallen leaves were littered in the hollows, whence rose, if you disturbed them, an acrid smell of the gas launched over the wood four days before, and everywhere among the undergrowth and the fallen trees ran a network of narrow trenches and shallow burrows from which rose the sound of


<pb n="144  IN THE WOOD"/>

talk and the smell of cooking, the resting-place of the supports who were to be ready that night to move up through the valley and sweep past a victorious front-line brigade into an enemy village two miles away.</p>

<p>All around the wood lay guns which barked occasionally ; in front of it was the shell-torn " valley of death," with its grim windings--" dead man's corner " and " suicide corner "--up which all troops had to go and on which the German barrage was regularly laid twice or three times a day; not a blade of grass was to be seen in the valley, nothing but huge shell-holes and heaped-up earth, seamed with old and new trenches and littered with all the waste products of a battle, dead men's equipment and rifles, bombs and shell-cases, huge duds, and here and there the wreck of an ambulance or an ammunition-waggon which had been caught by German shells. Now the valley lay in its hideous squalor basking in the sun, while overhead droned an aeroplane—British it must be, of course.</p>

<p>A whistle sounded, and the men in the wood, who lay lazily watching the 'plane, looked round suddenly in alarm. It was a Bosche, was it ? Well, wasn't that the limit ? Most of them were young drafts and didn't understand, but the old hands enlightened them. The Bosche might spot them in that thinned wood, and if it did--well, they wouldn't do any harm if they



<pb n="IN THE WOOD  145"/>

got down into a trench for a bit. All slipped down, while on the circling enemy above came rushing two British 'planes, driving him back to his own Une. And the incident was apparently at an end. Men got out of their trench once more, and went about the business of the day. Rifles were inspected and bombs issued, for the attack would begin at six o'clock that evening, and they had to be ready to move at five.Runners crossed from Company to Company, officers moved among the burrows as they packed up. Their dinner-hour was just over, and the smoke of many pipes rose upon the air. A Subaltern came strolling across the open to his Company trench, a pipe in his mouth, and his kilt swinging jauntily.</p>

<p>Whee-ee-ee-errump ! The air was full of dust and smoke from a little way up the trench. The Subaltern had slid into the trench at the sound, with a rapidity very unlike his former stroll; as he picked himself up--a large lump of earth had hit him in the chest--there came a rush of men away from the smoke towards him, and more crashes on his right and left. In the trees above he heard the vicious sound of bursting shrapnel.</p>

<p>" We'r trench is blown in on us," gasped a man running, with wild eyes, to some shelter--he knew not quite what.</p>


<pb n="146  IN THE WOOD"/>



<p>Behind the Subaltern came a shout from another of his Company Mess.</p>

<p>" You can't let those men any farther up, Tagg. There's a dead end here ; they've blown in our trench, and we'll have to dig some men out.    Pass up tools."</p>

<p>" Can't get any farther, Murray," said MacTaggart the Subaltern, " get down--oh, Lord, here's another."</p>

<p>Another long-drawn whine was followed by a crash so close that the trench seemed to collapse though it was only loose earth falling. The Subaltern saw the mess dixie hurled into a bush, and the terrified man beside him darted his head into a little hole in the side of the trench. Over the Subaltern came the bombardment feeling ; a sensation which mingles a curious numbness of all ordinary emotions with an abounding pride and a complete contempt for anybody more frightened than oneself; he turned slowly to the man and told him to take his head out of the hole.</p>

<p>" It'll come in on you if a crump drops near," he said, " and then you'll suffocate.    Have a cigarette."</p>

<p>The man rejected the offer with scorn, as badly shell-shocked men will.</p>

<p>" Well, don't be so proud about it," said the Subaltern," I wish I could find my pipe," and began to grope for it. The


<pb n="IN THE WOOD  147"/>

men in the trench crouched listening for the whining to come near to them, and as it did, the. Subaltern ceased looking for his pipe and listened with them. Along the trench came shouts from those digging out the buried men. A Corporal had got on top and was digging there unmindful of the shrapnel.</p>

<p>I don't know if I have given the impression that the Subaltern was a fearless young gentleman; but if so, it was not my intention. He was very afraid and most unwilling to die, and he showed it, if the men had only noticed, by his nervous movement of relief after each close burst. A somewhat vigorous self-control, combined with a very real pleasure in beings so close to death and yet alive, enabled him to delude the privates ; but inside he was quaking.</p>

<p>At last the barrage moved on to the other side of the wood and he rose up, suddenly remembering that he had not seen his Captain since it began. He hardly dared get out, so numb was his will, when he saw the Captain leap down into the trench.</p>

<p>" I was in the burrow," the big man explained, rather breathlessly, " so I stayed there. There's one chap killed, and one wounded just outside it, and a lot more farther along.I wonder where the stretcher-bearers are."</p>

<p>The Subaltern felt that he ought to get out, but somehow he couldn't.   What if the barrage started again and caught

<pb n="148  IN THE WOOD"/>

him in the open ? He climbed out and stood on the edge ready to jump down again if another shell came. From the next trench stretcher-bearers moved towards him looking for wounded. Almost beside him a man lay in a dabble of blood; you would have thought him asleep until you saw half his head lying beside him cut neatly off by a big piece of shell. Farther over they had dug out the buried men, but only one was alive. The Corporal, who had worked so gallantly in the bombardment, collapsed suddenly with twitching hands and staring, frightened eyes, proclaiming the shell-shock he had held off while the work had to be done.Stretcher-bearers came, carrying broken moaning wounded.The Subaltern, shamed by their calm, braced himself and stepped into the open.</p>

<p>There he met another Sub. helping along a Captain, an old friend of his. MacTaggart greeted him cheerily, and was answered by a hopeless stare and a writhing mouth trying in vain to form words.   The Captain was dumb.</p>

<p>" That last 8-inch burst almost on him," the other Subaltern explained. " All the men with him were killed, and he's got it badly.   Come on now, Willie.    It's all right now."</p>

<p>The dumb man mumbled piteously and cringed to the ground as a shell whined over. The two started to take him along to


<pb n="IN THE WOOD  149"/>

the Aid Post, but every movement was a difficulty to his uncontrolled limbs, and every sound a torture to the bewildered brain. It was a long time before they got there, and when they did, the Aid Post was like a shambles with blood and wounded men,. The two slung their friend down to the doctor,and went to report him a casualty at Headquarters next door.There the C.O. met them with operation orders for the attack that night, and a request that MacTaggart would take certain messages to other Companies. As they went in for a final farewell to the dumb Captain, he moaned and stretched forward his wavering hand for the orders, the last effort of a gallant spirit. Then they left him in the Aid Post, and went out to their work.</p>

<p>As MacTaggart crossed the open he was gripped with a sudden fear. The whining and the crash of the shells was coming nearer again, and he had two Companies to see before he could get back to his own burrow. He ran hastily over to the first Coy, H.Q., and then paused there, bracing himself for his next rush, for the barrage was on their lines again, although not so heavily. Out he ran and along to the next H.Q., fixing his mind on the job, and not allowing himself to think of shells, when a low shrapnel, beautifully timed, burst close beside him, knocking him over;  picking himself


<pb n="150  IN THE WOOD"/>

up he staggered to the trench and handed over the message, only conscious of a sudden quiet, for that shrapnel had been the last shell of the barrage. Then he found his mouth full of blood and his limbs weak and tottering. He was not wounded he knew; he supposed it must be shell-shock.</p>

<p>At Headquarters he reported the messages delivered, and got some opium from the doctor ; in a dream he got rum, then his own men, and found new vigour in his limbs and ferocity in his mind. " Go down ? I'm damned if I will," he muttered,and walked along the trench. The British barrage was on now, and the troops were all ready to move up.</p>

<p>" Will we get into them, sir ? " men asked him as he walked along the top of the trench. " Will we get into the---------s with the bayonet ? "They were flushed and excited with anticipation and rum, and MacTaggart wondered whether what was left of the old men would carry these raw boys on, or whether they would run and disgrace the regiment. He knew that they had lost a quarter of their strength in the barrage and mostly from his own Company; and he was too old a soldier to be reassured by this feverish talk about bayonets.</p>

<p>" Oh, we'll get into them all right," he said, " We'll give 'em a good deal for this afternoon, and we'll pay them all


<pb n="IN THE WOOD  151"/>

right," but inwardly he was thinking of these boys moving up through another barrage, and his mind was full of foreboding.</p>

<p>In the trench he found the other officers, and knew they were thinking the same.</p>

<p>" The old hands ought to help them on," said his Captain doubtfully, " But I wish we hadn't lost so many to-day.It'll shake them a bit."</p>

<p>" What is to-day ?" said MacTaggart inconsequently. " Sunday, isn't it ? "</p>

<p>A voice from a private echoed his question a little way along. There was a buzz of conversation and suddenly a hush. The strong voice of a Sergeant was lifted up in the shaking lilt of an old Psalm tune.</p>

<p>" By God," breathed the Subaltern, as the other voices joined in. " They're the old gang yet."</p>

<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>He took me from the fearful pit</l>
<l rend="inline">And from the miry clay,</l>
<l>And on a rock he set my feet,</l>
<l rend="inline">Establishing my way.</l></lg></q>

<p>The Psalm ended; another voice said, " I'll give you a grand one for this day, boy," and once again the strong rough voices rang out through the wood, grim earnestness in every tone :</p>


<pb n="152  IN THE WOOD"/>

<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>Now Israel may say, and that truly</l>
<l>If that the Lord had not been on our side,</l>
<l>If that the Lord had not our cause maintained</l>
<l>When cruel men against us furiously</l>
<l>Rose up in wrath to make of us their prey.</l></lg></q>

<p>A runner came to them with a message. The Captain read it, and stood up, shaking his equipment on to his shoulders.</p>

<p>From the valley beyond came the roar of the German barrage, but over it rose the psalm,</p>

<q><lg>
<l>Therefore our trust is in the Lord his name,</l>
<l>Who heaven and earth by his own power did frame.</l></lg></q>

<p>There was a sudden silence and a shout from the Captain. " Get on your equipment, men. We're to move up now," and the officers strolled along to their platoons with light hearts.Whatever happened they knew the men would follow them.The spirit of the regiment was still the same.</p></div>

<p>"I THINK this was the place, Sirr," said the Sergeant, glaring through his periscope at the German trench sixty yards away. "It was on the parapet yonder--that he died, Sirr--was it not ? "</p>

<p>His usually loud and hearty voice was hushed to that subdued tone in which the British soldier mentions the dead, and the Captain who stood beside him wondered why it should jar so. It wasn't as if the Sergeant didn't feel it, he thought--disgust at pretended reverence and emotion was natural and easy to understand--but he knew there was no veil of hypocrisy in this case for his candour to penetrate and his mind to revolt at. That hushed tone was offspring partly of pity for the dead man and partly of respect for his own grief at the loss of his friend, chiefly perhaps of reverence for an experience beyond the Sergeant's knowledge and for the human spirit which had faced it.   It was his own damned fastidiousness


<pb n="154  GOLD BRAID"/>

of mind that was wrong; always suspecting unreality sub-consciously even when he knew it wasn't there. No, perhaps it was that fear and reverence of death that irritated ; he had never been afraid of death--nor had old Andy.</p>

<p>" Don't put it in so high up, boys," he said. " They'll see it and knock this bay to hell." The men lowered the wooden cross till the position met with their officer's approval. He watched it sombrely--that little cross was all they had to show for Andy; that and memory. It was a good thing Andy didn't care about being buried properly and death and hell and all that rot.</p>

<p>He read the inscription again as the men wired it into position against the parapet.</p>

<q>
<l>IN MEMORY OF</l>
<l>LIEUT. ANDREW MACKAY</l>
<l>A  CO.  1ST  SUTHERLAND  HIGHLANDERS</l>
<l>KILLED IN ACTION</l>
<l>IN  THE  GERMAN  TRENCH</l>
<l>OPPOSITE THIS POINT.</l></q>

<p>His mind went back to that trench opposite this point three days ago--the yelling and the noise and the fierce excitement


<pb n="GOLD BRAID  155"/>

of killing, and Andy--Andy with his arm and half his side torn off, telling him to take the others. Andy's lips telling them to leave him, but his eyes asking dumbly to be taken too. " I'm pretending to be damned brave, old man," the eyes had said, " and I hope the men believe me--but surely you can see what I want." He called himself a liar for thinking Andy hadn't been afraid to die. " I'm afraid, Tagg,"the eyes had said, " afraid of dying here away among these bloody Bosches. Oh, take my body back anyway and bury me with my own people." He supposed those queer feelings he had always laughed at, were strongest in the end--and he hadn't been able to get the body in. Andy had died on the Bosche parapet and he'd had the wounded to bring in, and that was the end of it all. He would never see Andy again, never stumble into the dugout to talk the world over with him, never drink with him in the jolly old billet, nor argue about art and lose his temper with him--never--never again. He felt he could have given all the rest if only Andy had been left--damned selfish--but he wouldn't have cared. What a bloody war it was. What was the sense of it all ? And he used to think war was good fun--but then Andy had been there to enjoy it with him. Why couldn't he die too ?</p>

<pb n="156  GOLD BRAID"/>

<p>" Look out, sirr," said a man, " oil can coming over." Instantly self-preservation reasserted itself. Gone was the mourner longing for death and peace; in his place a wary animal, alert and fearful, watched the falling bomb with rapid and instinctive calculation.</p>
