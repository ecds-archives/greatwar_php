<l>RETROGRESSION</l>

<l>Our daughters flower in vernal grace;</l>
<l>In strength our striplings wax apace;</l>
<l>Our cities teem ; our commerce rides</l>
<l>Sovereign upon the fawning tides.</l>
<l>But while, to this our stronghold&#x2014;where</l>
<l>The North Wind's wandering children fair,</l>
<l>Like wild birds from the waters sprung,</l>
<l>Built their wild nest and reared their young&#x2014;</l>
<l>The fleets of peace for ever pour</l>
<l>Fruitage and vintage, gems and ore;</l>
<l>While here, within each ocean gate.</l>
<l>Long barricadoed against Fate,</l>
<l>We are served by all the alien seas.</l>
<l>And fed from the Antipodes,</l>

RETROGRESSION</l>

<l>Lo, everywhere the unplenished brain!</l>
<l>Everywhere, dire as bondman's chain,</l>
<l>Or laws that crush, or creeds that blind,</l>
<l>The leanness of the unnourished mind.</l>





<l>For few and fewer do they grow.</l>
<l>Who know, or ever cared to know,</l>
<l>The great things greatly said and sung</l>
<l>In this heroic English tongue.</l>
<l>This craggy speech, the rough-wrought key</l>
<l>To palaces of wizardry.</l>
<l>Our fathers' glory, and our despair ;</l>
<l>And many a fabric hung in air.</l>
<l>That firmer stands than boastful stone ;</l>
<l>And many a tower of vigil lone.</l>
<l>Whence Wisdom sees, beneath her curled,</l>
<l>The involved, inextricable world.</l>

<l>And shouldst thou have in thee to-day</l>
<l>Aught thou canst better sing than say.</l>
<l>Shun, if thou wouldst by men be heard.</l>
<l>The comely phrase, the wellborn word.</l>
<l>And use, as for their ears more meet,</l>
<l>The loose-lipped lingo of the street,</l>
<l>A language Milton's kin have long</l>
<l>Accounted good enough for song.</l>
<l>Or don that vesture not less vile.</l>
<l>The beaded and bespangled style—</l>
<l>Diction o'erloaded and impure.</l>
<l>Thy thought lost in its garniture.</l>
<l>Till this itself becomes the goal.</l>
<l>The alpha, omega, and whole ;</l>
<l>Thy Muse, ev'n to her raiment's hem,</l>
<l>Huddling uncostly gem on gem.</l>
<l>Striving her lax form to bestar</l>

<l>With all crude ornaments that are ;</l>
<l>An empty and a dreary strife,</l>
<l>Vulgar in Letters as in Life.</l>

<l>Nor look for praise, save here and there</l>
<l>From a fast-dwindling remnant rare.</l>
<l>If thou beget with happy pain</l>
<l>The ordered and the governed strain</l>
<l>That peradventure had not shamed</l>
<l>Masters felicitously famed ,</l>
<l>Dryden, the athlete large and strong.</l>
<l>Lord of the nerve and sinew of song ;</l>
<l>The easeful victor, who subdued</l>
<l>Till conquest was but habitude ;</l>
<l>A hewer and shaper who could see</l>
<l>In adamant plasticity,</l>
<l>Who tore from the entrails of the mine</l>

<l>The metal of his iron line—</l>

<l>Iron that oft all molten rolled.</l>

<l>Heaved to a billow, and crashed to gold ,</l>

<l>Who, bom beside the haughty tomb</l>

<l>Of that rank time of overbloom</l>

<l>When poets vied in gathering each</l>

<l>Full-bosomed apple and buxom peach</l>

<l>That odorous in the orchard burned,</l>

<l>Had, from their purple surfeit, leamed</l>

<l>The truth in Hellas seen so plain.</l>

<l>That the art of arts is to refrain ;—</l>

<l>Or Gray, who on worn thoughts conferred</l>

<l>That second youth, the perfect word.</l>

<l>The elected and predestined phrase</l>

<l>That had lain bound, long nights and days.</l>

<l>To wear at last, when once set free.</l>

<l>Immortal pellucidity ;</l>

<l>And who, in that most mighty Ode,</l>
<l>That like a pageant streamed and glowed.</l>
<l>Called up anew mid breathing things</l>
<l>The great ghosts of our tragic Kings,</l>
<l>With doom-dark brows to come and go,</l>
<l>Trailing the folds of gorgeous woe.</l>

<l>THE MOSSGROWN PORCHES</l>

<l>When, as of old in Rome's imperial world,</l>
<l>Fair, conquered gods are from their temples</l>

<l>hurled.</l>
<l>And some rude, vehement Peter puts to flight</l>
<l>Some serene Phoebus, lord of lore and light,</l>
<l>In wastes and wilds, by fount and cavemed hill,</l>
<l>Secretly, furtively, are worshipped still.</l>
<l>With the sad zeal of vainly pious knees.</l>
<l>The ancient, the deposed divinities.</l>
<l>Heaven's outcasts, the great exiles of the sky.</l>
<l>Once mighty to do all things, save to die.</l>

<l>So, though in kingdoms of the Lyre to-day</l>
<l>I see the new faiths push the old away—</l>

<l>19</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>20            THE  MOSSGROWN  PORCHES</l>

<l>See the hot hierophants of each strange shrine</l>
<l>Offer oblation to all gods but mine.</l>
<l>And proudliest build their sanctuary and home</l>
<l>Where broods, on England's Tiber, England's</l>

<l>Rome;</l>
<l>Yet, mid a revel of change, unchanged I turn</l>
<l>To the lom haunts where older altars burn,—</l>
<l>There seek, companioned by the lessening few</l>
<l>Whose faith is as mine own, the gods I knew ;</l>
<l>Seek in deep clefts, and hushed in forests find,</l>
<l>The far-withdrawn Olympians of the mind.</l>
<l>Nor ever doubt, that among wondering men</l>
<l>These deathless will in triumph come again.</l>
<l>As sure as the droop'd year's remounting curve.</l>
<l>And reign anew, when I no more shall serve.</l>

<l>THE SEXES OF SONG</l>

<l>First in the empire of the Muse</l>
<l>Are the broad athletes, the all-male,</l>

<l>Who from their cradles had the thews</l>
<l>That unwithstandably prevail.</l>

<l>But many a province she possesses,</l>
<l>Rich in fair manors and proud seats.</l>

<l>Bestowed on such great poetesses</l>
<l>As Shelley and June-hearted Keats.</l>

<l>[Lines written near the burial-place of Burns]</l>

<l>Poet, whose very dust, here shed.</l>
<l>Is as the quick among the dead.</l>
<l>Where revels thy carousing soul ?</l>
<l>What Hebe fills what mighty bowl.</l>
<l>Mantling with what immortal drink ?</l>

<l>3J»                                             9|?                                             «^                                             iJ5                                             *I%</l>

<l>Nay, great and blissful one ! I think</l>
<l>That, taught by Time himself to flee</l>
<l>The taverns of Eternity,</l>
<l>Amid yon constellations thou</l>
<l>Drivest all night the heavenly Plough,</l>
<l>Wooing with song some sky-nymph fair</l>
<l>Who sits in Cassiopeia's Chair,</l>

<l>Or half unravels on her knees</l>

<l>That tangled net, the Pleiades,</l>

<l>Or, at thy over amorous strain</l>

<l>Bridling with wrath she needs must feign,</l>

<l>Flits to a region pale and gray.</l>

<l>Shimmers through nebula away,</l>

<l>Coldly beyond thy fires to roam.</l>

<l>Hid in Orion's astral foam.</l>

<l>But wandering back, with starlike tears</l>

<l>Yields to the Ploughman of the Spheres.</l>

<l>SHAKESPEARE</l>

<l>0 LET me leave the plains behind,</l>
<l>And let me leave the vales below !</l>

<l>Into the highlands of the mind.</l>
<l>Into the mountains let me go.</l>

<l>My Keats, my Spenser, loved I well;</l>

<l>Gardens and statued lawns were these ;</l>
<l>Yet not for ever could I dwell</l>

<l>In arbours and in pleasances.</l>

<l>Here are the heights, crest beyond crest.</l>
<l>With Himalayan dews impearled ,</l>

<l>And I will watch from Everest</l>
<l>The long heave of the surging world.</l>

<l>TRADITION IN ART AND LETTERS</l>

<l>She guards, not binds, coerces not, but</l>
<l>shields,</l>

<l>And o'er this proud though little land of Me,</l>
<l>Not an immediate governance she wields.</l>

<l>But a Protectorate and a Suzerainty.</l>

<l>Within her ambience, fetterless I dwell.</l>
<l>Under the still monition of her eye.</l>

<l>Not my custodian she, but sentinel.</l>
<l>And less a bound or barrier than a sky.</l>

<l>Therefore I keep, or strive to keep, her law.</l>
<l>While some break from her with insurgence</l>
<l>rude;</l>
<l>And as for these, when I looked forth and saw</l>
<l>Their liberty, then chose I servitude.</l>

<l>NATURE'S WAY</l>

<l>" Faultily faultless " may be ill—</l>
<l>" Carefully careless " is worse still.</l>
<l>I bought one day a book of rhyme—</l>
<l>One long, fierce flout at tune and time ;</l>
<l>Ragged and jagged by intent.</l>
<l>As if each line were earthquake-rent,</l>
<l>Leagues on seismal leagues of it.</l>
<l>Not unheroically writ.</l>
<l>By one of whom I had been told</l>
<l>That he, in scorn of canons old,</l>
<l>Pedantic laws effete and dead.</l>
<l>Went fearless to the pure well-head</l>
<l>Of song's most ancient legislature—</l>
<l>Art's uncorrupted mother. Nature.</l>

<l>NATURE S  WAY                        ^^</l>

<l>Nature ! whose lapidary seas</l>
<l>Labour a pebble without ease.</l>
<l>Till they unto perfection bring</l>
<l>That miracle of polishing ;</l>
<l>Who never negligently yet</l>
<l>Fashioned an April violet.</l>
<l>Nor would forgive, did June disclose</l>
<l>Unceremoniously the rose;</l>
<l>Who makes the toadstool in the grass</l>
<l>The carven ivory surpass.</l>
<l>So guiltless of a fault or slip</l>
<l>Is its victorious workmanship ,</l>
<l>Who suffers us pure Form to see</l>
<l>In a dead leaf's anatomy ;</l>
<l>And pondering long where greenly sleep</l>
<l>The unravished secrets of the deep.</l>
<l>Bids the all-courted pearl express</l>

<l>28                          NATURE S  WAY</l>

<l>Her final thoughts on flawlessness ;</l>

<l>But visibly aches when doomed to bring</l>

<l>Some inchoate amorphous thing,</l>

<l>Loathed by its very mother for</l>

<l>The unfinish she doth most abhor,</l>

<l>Into a world her curious wit</l>

<l>Would fain have shaped all-exquisite</l>

<l>As the acorn cup's simplicity.</l>

<l>Or the Moon's patience with the sea.</l>

<l>Or the superb, the golden grief</l>

<l>Of each October for each leaf.</l>

<l>Phrased in a rhetoric that excels</l>

<l>Isaiah's and Ezekiel's.</l>

<l>ON A CAROLINE POET</l>

<l>This lord of a romantic wit</l>
<l>Was subtle without knowing it;</l>
<l>For Subtlety expires in air</l>
<l>If of herself she grow aware.</l>

<l>Oft with a reveller's gait did he</l>
<l>Stagger into profundity,</l>
<l>As mariners that chartless rove</l>
<l>May drift on isles of treasure-trove.</l>

<l>ART'S RIDDLE</l>

<l>Go to , I also would her skein unravel.</l>

<l>Art is not Nature warped in man's control.</l>
<l>But Nature's reminiscences of travel</l>

<l>Across an artist's soul.</l>

<l>Or 'tis a tidal river, that, each day.</l>
<l>Ebbing and flowing under cliff and tree,</l>

<l>With mutual and eternal interplay</l>
<l>Takes and gives back the sea.</l>

<l>TO A STRENUOUS CRITIC</l>

<l>The lofty bearing of a phrase.</l>

<l>" This has no import for the age ! "</l>
<l>And so your votive wreaths you heap</l>

<l>THE BALLAD OF THE BOOTMAKER</l>

<l>[A Fable for Poets]</l>
<l>I WENT into a bootmaker's,</l>

<l>A pair of boots to buy.</l>
<l>Upon the morrow morn those boots</l>

<l>Let in the rain and sky.</l>

<l>Then to the bootman I retumed,</l>

<l>And cold, cold were my feet;</l>
<l>But my vocabulary was</l>

<l>Of equatorial heat.</l>

<l>" 'Tis true," quoth he, " the boots you bought</l>

<l>Are palpably a pair</l>
<l>Not made for such ignoble ends</l>

<l>As vulgar use and wear.</l>
<l>34</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE BALLAD OF THE BOOTMAKER  35</l>

<l>"Rather have they been fashioned forth</l>

<l>By one who did disdain</l>
<l>The shallow art of making boots</l>

<l>That will keep out the rain.</l>

<l>"His loftier dream is to conceive</l>

<l>A boot that sets no bars</l>
<l>To the free ingress of the heavens</l>

<l>And visits of the stars.</l>

<l>"In his impassioned bootmanship</l>

<l>Foiled gropings are discerned</l>
<l>Toward some visionary boot</l>

<l>For which the ages yearned.</l>

<l>"His baffled flight, his broken wing.</l>

<l>His heart-cry and his pain.</l>
<l>Are worth a million perfect boots</l>

<l>That will keep out the rain."</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>36  THE BALLAD OF THE BOOTMAKER</l>

<l>" Your words," said I, "are passing fine,</l>

<l>But let my boots be made</l>
<l>By handicraftsmen who were not</l>

<l>Too great to learn their trade.</l>

<l>" The thirst for the Infinitudes</l>

<l>Will scarce with me atone</l>
<l>For upper leathers badly botched</l>

<l>And soles as badly sewn.</l>

<l>" I cannot rate his bootcraft high</l>

<l>Who principally lives</l>
<l>To obliterate the differences</l>

<l>Observed 'twixt boots and sieves.</l>

<l>" Not that T would on Art's free spirit</l>

<l>A deadening yoke impose !</l>
<l>Let boots express the bootmaker</l>

<l>And all he feels and knows.</l>

<l>THE BALLAD OF THE BOOTMAKER  37</l>

<l>" 'Tis meet, 'tis well!   But I shall yet</l>

<l>For evermore retain</l>
<l>My old, my early love of boots</l>

<l>That will keep out the rain."</l>

<l>With that I doffed the boots I loathed,</l>

<l>And nought besides did say.</l>
<l>But heaved them at the bootster's head</l>

<l>And bootless went my way.</l>

<l>To muse upon a universe</l>
<l>That seemed, when I was young,</l>

<l>A place where boots were better made,</l>
<l>And songs were better sung.</l>

<l>THE GIANTS AND THE ELVES</l>

<l>It is enough to make</l>

<l>Chaucer, that other April;  where alone</l>

<l>Earth could conceive and bear</l>

<l>Shakespeare , where Milton reigned on awe¬</l>
<l>some throne.</l>

<l>And Dryden governed from more mundane</l>
<l>chair;</l>

<l>All perfect masters of their perfect tools,</l>

<l>And royally skilled to take</l>

<l>From each its utmost yield of service fair,</l>

<l>I am put off with posturing fools</l>

<l>Who in such presences cackle all day of Blake.</l>

<l>THE YAPPING CUR</l>

<l>I WAS walking in the sun, my day's work</l>
<l>done.</l>
<l>And the great world rolled like a wheel.</l>
<l>When a cur came yapping,  came yap-yap-</l>
<l>yapping.</l>
<l>When a cur came yapping at my heel.</l>

<l>Along the pleasant way where the little folk</l>
<l>play.</l>
<l>Past   the   church, where   the  grown folk</l>
<l>kneel.</l>
<l>The tiresome, monotonous, interminable yap¬</l>
<l>ping,</l>
<l>The yapping of the cur at my heel!</l>
<l>39</l>

<l>40                    THE  YAPPING  CUR</l>

<l>Were he hungry I would feed him at my cot</l>
<l>hard by,</l>
<l>Where are hearts that have hungred and</l>
<l>can feel.</l>
<l>He is fed as well as I am, and housed as well</l>
<l>as I,</l>
<l>And   his   pastime   is   yapping   at    one's</l>
<l>heel.</l>





<l>Shall I send him all asprawl from my good</l>
<l>stout shoe,</l>
<l>Turn   his   yapping   to   a   yelping  and   a</l>
<l>squeal ?</l>
<l>Nay, leave him to the thing Fate fashioned</l>
<l>him to do—</l>
<l>His dog's-work of yapping at one's heel.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE  YAPPING   CUR                    41</l>

<l>For God made the arrows that around life</l>
<l>whirr.</l>
<l>And the thunders that above life peal,</l>
<l>And He made, too, the miserable, mangy little</l>
<l>cur.</l>
<l>And its instinct for yapping at one's heel.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE SURPRISE</l>

<l>They thought they had left him lying well¬</l>
<l>nigh dead,</l>

<l>So many javelins had been cast at him.</l>

<l>So many dinting blows</l>

<l>Upon his casque and cataphract had rung.</l>

<l>So many stones had with shrill whirr been</l>
<l>slung.</l>

<l>But whole of heart and limb.</l>

<l>At day droop he uplifted his prone head.</l>

<l>Propped him upon an elbow—suddenly rose—</l>

<l>Woke his lulled sword and the vain scabbard</l>
<l>shed,</l>

<l>Struck out at all his foes.</l>

<l>And got him victory ere the day was sped.</l>

<l>ON A TOO PROLIFIC ESSAYIST</l>

<l>The cruellest torture that a man can know.</l>

<l>Surely it were a torment like in kind.</l>
<l>If in degree less maddening, to sit still</l>

<l>THE ETERNAL SEARCH</l>

<l>My little maiden two years old, just able</l>

<l>To tower full half a head above the table,</l>

<l>With inquisition keen must needs explore</l>

<l>Whatever in my dwelling hath a door.</l>

<l>Whatever is behind a curtain hid.</l>

<l>Or lurks, a rich enigma, 'neath a lid.</l>

<l>So soon is the supreme desire confessed.</l>

<l>To probe the unknown !   So soon begins the</l>

<l>quest,</l>
<l>That never ends until asunder fall</l>
<l>The locks and bolts of the last door of all.</l>

<l>RAPTURE</l>

<l>Out of the east wind, making gray</l>
<l>The face of the dejected day,</l>
<l>I stept into a minster, where</l>
<l>Aisles of praise and towers of prayer.</l>
<l>Fencing me from all the strife</l>
<l>Of this illegible, blurred life.</l>
<l>Took and folded up and furled</l>
<l>The undecipherable world.</l>

<l>And there it seemed that I forgot</l>
<l>All I would fain remember not ;</l>
<l>Folly's works by fools adored ;</l>
<l>The senseless gun, the soulless sword.</l>
<l>And through the flushed and jewelled gloom</l>
<l>68</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>RAPTURE                             69</l>

<l>That rubied some Crusader's tomb.</l>
<l>There rose and rolled a golden wave.</l>
<l>That, thundering down the cloudy nave,</l>
<l>Ravishingly with violence sweet</l>
<l>Stormed the earth from 'neath my feet.</l>
<l>Swept me as a leaf abroad</l>
<l>In great tides of billowing laud.</l>
<l>Leaving me at last afar.</l>
<l>Derelict on an island star.</l>
<l>Ruthlessly and blissfully</l>
<l>Cast up as jetsam of the sea</l>
<l>That visits with all-linking flow</l>
<l>Each heavenly archipelago.</l>

<l>TO A VIOLONCELLO</l>

<l>Well, O 'Cello, love I all thy mellow</l>

<l>Deeps of golden sound !</l>

<l>Tell, O 'Cello, tell me where thy fellow</l>

<l>May on earth be found ?</l>

<l>Or, if such be past our finding here.</l>

<l>In what sphere</l>

<l>That brooks no galling bound.</l>

<l>Far beyond the light wherein thou dwellest.</l>

<l>What immortal, what celestial 'Cellist</l>

<l>Wields the bow that bids the world go round ?</l>

<l>HER THIRD BIRTHDAY</l>

<l>My tiny lady, can it</l>

<l>Be true that you and I,</l>
<l>On something called a planet.</l>

<l>Are somewhere in the sky ?</l>

<l>Yes—and at such a tearing</l>
<l>And madcap speed we've spun.</l>

<l>That you, with dreadful daring.</l>
<l>Have thrice been round the sun.</l>

<l>Nay, it yet more amazes.</l>
<l>That my far-venturing girl</l>

<l>Can be as fresh as daisies</l>
<l>After so wild a whirl!</l>
<l>71</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>HER THIRD  BIRTHDAY</l>

<l>And now 'neath western billow</l>

<l>The sun is put to bed.</l>
<l>And you, too, on your pillow</l>

<l>Must lay a golden head.</l>

<l>Ah, tears—they come so quickly.</l>
<l>For grief so quickly gone !</l>

<l>Yet joys have rained as thickly.</l>
<l>For you to dream upon.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>DISCLOSURE</l>

<l>We dwelt by western shores, and there.</l>
<l>Watching a hill that watched the wave.</l>

<l>We called him dull in pose and air,</l>
<l>A bulk not grand but merely grave—</l>

<l>So many mountains had we seen.</l>

<l>Kingly of build and port and mien.</l>

<l>Then came a snowstorm in the night.</l>
<l>And all his ribs of rock, next mom.</l>

<l>All his anatomy, sprang to light,</l>

<l>With form and feature, carved and worn.</l>

<l>That rose out of the sea's abyss</l>

<l>Magnificent in emphasis.</l>

<l>73</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>74                             DISCLOSURE</l>

<l>Imagine not that thou canst know</l>
<l>Mountains or men in very truth.</l>

<l>Until the tempest and the snow</l>

<l>Strike them at midnight without ruth.</l>

<l>And publish clear, in morning's gaze,</l>

<l>The lineaments they strove to erase.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>EDENHUNGER</l>

<l>O THAT a nest, my mate ! were once more ours.</l>
<l>Where we, by vain and barren change un-</l>
<l>tortured.</l>
<l>Could have grave friendships with wise trees</l>
<l>and flowers.</l>
<l>And live the great, green life of field and</l>
<l>orchard !</l>

<l>From the cold birthday of the daffodils,</l>

<l>Ev'n to that listening pause that is November,</l>
<l>O to confide in woods, confer with hills.</l>
<l>And   then—then,   to   that   palmland   you</l>
<l>remember,</l>

<l>75</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>76                         EDENHUNGER</l>

<l>Fly swift, where seas that brook not Winter's</l>
<l>rule</l>
<l>Are one vast violet breaking into lilies</l>
<l>There where we spent our first strange wedded</l>
<l>Yule,</l>
<l>In the far, golden, fire-hearted Antilles.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE BETTER CHOICE</l>

<l>The wintry sun is a miser.</l>
<l>Whose joy is to hoard and hold ,</l>

<l>But the summer sun is wiser—</l>
<l>He freely spends his gold.</l>

<l>With lavish and broad dispersal.</l>
<l>Around and beneath and above.</l>

<l>He sows his wealth universal.</l>
<l>And reaps universal love.</l>

<l>TO MY ELDEST CHILD</l>

<l>My little firstborn daughter sweet—</l>
<l>My child, yet half of alien race—</l>

<l>England and Ireland surely meet.</l>
<l>Their feuds forgotten, in thy face.</l>

<l>To both these lands I'd have thee give</l>
<l>Thy maiden heart, surrendered free;</l>

<l>For both alike I'd have thee live.</l>
<l>Since both alike do live in thee.</l>

<l>In thee they lay their strife aside.</l>
<l>That were so worn with dire unrest,</l>

<l>These whom the waters parted wide.</l>
<l>But who commingle in thy breast.</l>
<l>78</l>

<l>TO MY  ELDEST CHILD                79</l>

<l>These will I teach thee to revere.</l>
<l>To love, and serve, and understand;</l>

<l>Nor chide thee if thou hold more dear</l>
<l>Thy mother's than thy father's land.</l>

<l>The English fields, in sun and rain.</l>
<l>Were round about thee at thy birth;</l>

<l>But thou shalt ache with Ireland's pain,</l>
<l>And thou shalt laugh with Ireland's mirth.</l>

<l>Thou shalt be taught her noble songs.</l>
<l>And thou shalt grieve whene'er is told</l>

<l>The story of her ancient wrongs,</l>
<l>The story of her sorrows old.</l>

<l>And often, m thy English home.</l>
<l>Her voice will call, and thou obey.</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>8o                TO  MY  ELDEST  CHILD</l>

<l>Thy heart will cross the sundering foam.</l>
<l>Thy soul to Ireland sail away</l>

<l>Ah, little flower !  in Irish ground</l>
<l>Thy roots are deeper than the sea.</l>

<l>Though English woodlands murmured round</l>
<l>The house of thy nativity.</l>

<l>Of both these peoples thou wert born ,</l>
<l>Of both these lands thou art the child ;</l>

<l>A symbol of the radiant morn</l>

<l>That shall behold them reconciled.</l>

<l>No wonder !   For the ancient legends say—</l>

<l>Dread comets ploughed of old the ethereal</l>

<l>The Hirsute Star loosing his locks abhorred.</l>
<l>Fierce shapes he took,   a bristled monster,</l>

<l>gored</l>

<l>Flowed on the neck of Night, a charger's mane ,</l>
<l>Or brandished in the zenith a hungry sword.</l>

<l>Or flashed in anger at a hateful deed.</l>

<l>Or loved a woman, or sinned a headlong sin !</l>

<l>In two score years grown old and moribund.</l>

<l>His lean soul, arid as the childless sands.</l>

<l>Crumbles, and dustily disintegrates.</l>

<l>Dies piecemeal, less lamented than a tree.</l>

<l>It is not the well-warmed, well-peopled house</l>
<l>That soonest falls to wrack. 'Tis the disused</l>
<l>And empty dwelling, that with fireless hearth,</l>
<l>Pictureless walls, and shuttered window panes.</l>

<l>THE PEER'S PROGRESS</l>

<l>[Verses on reading that Lord Aberdeen was about to be</l>
<l>made Marquess of Aberdeen and Tara.J</l>

<l>Tara, the place of Kings, the hill of Fate—</l>
<l>Tara,   the  throne of   Song,  the  hallowed</l>
<l>shrine—</l>
<l>Tagged as a tassel to your marquessate.</l>
<l>Made an appurtenance of your house and</l>

<l>times o'er ?</l>
<l>Bemarquess'd   or   beduked—^who   cares   a</l>

<l>" Marquess of Aberdeen and Sinai "—</l>
<l>Consider !—were not this ev'n better still ?</l>

<l>God made me English—English through and</l>
<l>through—</l>

<l>But, bound to Ireland by one bond supreme,</l>
<l>I know her soul—something unknown to you—</l>
<l>Her vision and her passion and her dream.</l>

<l>I know, as all know who have breathed her air.</l>
<l>How transient, how unrooted in her heart—</l>

<l>A mere ephemeral thing of passage there—</l>
<l>Were you, that in her glories claim a part.</l>

<l>And this last insult before gazing men—</l>
<l>This ignominy the bitterest yet by far—</l>

<l>She will remember and forgive not, when</l>
<l>You in Time's volume an erasure are.</l>

<l>THE  peer's  PROGRESS              93</l>

<l>You, soon enough, will be by her forgot ;</l>

<l>Lodged in some suburb of her thoughts were</l>
<l>you;</l>
<l>But this will as a proverb live, of what</l>

<l>Dull, sightless, soulless statesmanship can do.</l>

<l>This profanation, blind and coarse and crude.</l>
<l>Of things the holiest held, from sea to sea.</l>

<l>This is immortal as Ineptitude,</l>
<l>This is eternal as Stupidity.</l>

<l>And ev'n to this, from all the ages past.</l>
<l>Through all the long self-torturings, Ireland</l>
<l>came;</l>

<l>Left to her disillusions at the last,</l>

<l>THE POEMS OF</l>
<l>WILLIAM  WATSON</l>

<l>Edited and arranged with an Introduction, by J. A. SPENDER.</l>
<l>In 2 Volumes.   With Portrait and many new Poems.</l>

<l>Crown Svo.   9s. net.</l>

<l>*«* This edition is the outcome of long and cartful preparation by ttu</l>
<l>A uthor, and contains hundreds of emendations which do not appear</l>
<l>in any previous volumes, and which in a large number of cases enhance</l>
<l>very materially the interest and value of the poems.</l>

<l>SOME   OPINIONS</l>

<l>Times.—"William Watson is, above all things, ian artist who is</l>
<l>proud of his calling and conscientious in every syllable that he writes.</l>
<l>To appreciate his work you must take it as a whole, for he is in a line</l>
<l>with tlie high priests of poetry, reared, like Ion, in the shadow of</l>
<l>Delphic presences and memories, and weighing every word of his</l>
<l>utterance before it is given to the world."</l>

<l>Athenaum.—" His poetry is a ' criticism of life,' and, viewedas such,</l>
<l>it is magnificent in its lucidity, its elegance, its dignity. We revere and</l>
<l>admire Mr. Watson's pursuit of a splendid ideal; and we are sure -that</l>
<l>his artistic self-mastery, will be rewarded by a secure place in the ranks</l>
<l>of our poets. . We may express our belief that Mr. Watson will</l>
<l>keep his high and honourable station when many showier but shallower</l>
<l>reputations have withered away, and must figure in any representative</l>
<l>anthology of English poetry."</l>

<l>Westminster Gazette.—"It is remarkable that when Mr. Watson's</l>
<l>poetry directly invites comparison with the poetry of preceding masters</l>
<l>his equality always, his incomparable superiority often, becomes</l>
<l>instantlyl apparent. . No discerning critic could doubt that there</l>
<l>are more elements of permanence in Mr. Watson's ipoems than in those</l>
<l>of any of his present contemporaries. . A very treasury of jewelled</l>
<l>aphorisms, as profound and subtle in wisdom and truth as they are</l>
<l>consummately felicitous in expression."</l>

<l>Bookman.—" From the very first in these columns we have pleaded</l>
<l>by sober argument, not by hysterical praise, Mr. Watson's right to the</l>
<l>foremost place among our living poets.    The book is         a collection</l>

<l>of works of art, like a cabinet of gems."</l>

<l>Spectator,—"The two volumes will be welcomed by the poet's</l>
<l>numerous admirers. There is a pleasure in the possession of a com¬</l>
<l>plete edition of a great writer's works. . We must apologise for</l>
<l>quoting so copiously, but the book is so full of beautiful things that in</l>
<l>his pleasure at seeing them altogether, the critic is irresistibly tempted</l>
<l>to take tliem out and remind his readers of them separately."</l>

<l>Large Svo.    21s. net.</l>

<l>SOME PRESS OPINIONS</l>

<l>Spectator,—" In these days of slipshod performance, com¬</l>
<l>bined with pretentious theories of art, it is a comfort to have</l>
<l>one man who holds by the old stern traditions, who reveres</l>
<l>his task, and scrupulously and honourably gives only of his</l>
<l>best. All Mr. Watson's work is the outcome of a clear and</l>
<l>sane philosophy of poetry. In .Stevenson's fine phrase his aim</l>
<l>is ' the piety of speech.'"</l>

<l>Daily Chronicle.—" Mr. Watson has much in common</l>
<l>with Tennyson as a lord of language. .         Since Landor</l>

<l>there have been few poets to equal Mr. Watson, in the grave</l>
<l>and terse expression of passionate thought."</l>

<l>Mr. James Douglas in Star.—"There is no longer a</l>
<l>famine in the land of poetry, for at last we have, in Mr.</l>
<l>William Watson's New Poems, a glorious harvest of majestic</l>
<l>song. The poet has vindicated his courageous silence, for</l>
<l>in this noble volume there is an emotional depth, an</l>
<l>intellectual variety, and a passionate splendour of inspiration</l>
<l>and of craftsmanship which would suffice to establish a great</l>
<l>reputation. The poet has already won a secure place among</l>
<l>our great poetic artists, and almost the highest praise we can</l>
<l>bestow upon these poems is to say that they .ire worthy of</l>
<l>him. Yet we can say more than this, for there are new notes</l>
<l>in them, notes of tenderness, of pity, of joy. . There are</l>
<l>many fine poems in this volume, but if I am not mistaken the</l>
<l>finest of all is this, A Tavern Song, which is beyond all</l>
<l>question a consummate masterpiece of homely English</l>
<l>humour and gusto."</l>

<l>BELGIAN POEMS:</l>

<l>CHANTS PATRIOTIQUES ET AUTRE</l>
<l>POEMES. By Emile Cammerts, with English</l>
<l>Translations by Tita Brand Cammaerts, and a</l>
<l>Portrait in Photogravure by Vernon Hill.</l>

<l>Crown Svo, 4s. 6d. net.</l>

<l>THE MORNING POST.</l>

<l>"Myrrh, Gold, Frankincense.</l>

<l>'' The proceeds of the first edition are to go to the Belgian</l>
<l>Soldiers' Fund for the purchase of tobacco.</l>

<l>" In his poems of peace-time—poems that are birthday songs</l>
<l>for Christ, poems of married lovers, mystic poems—M. Cam¬</l>
<l>maerts has proved himself one of the strongest and sweetest of</l>
<l>Belgian singers and makers, a master of the aurea mediocritas,</l>
<l>even in moments of the utmost freedom from the fetters curiously</l>
<l>wrought in antique gold, of Latin rhyme and rhythm. In his</l>
<l>' Noels ' tenderness and reverence are mingled in truly medieval</l>
<l>fashion ; the child-Christ is to him truly a new-born Child, and</l>
<l>as truly the crowned Ancient of Days.</l>

<l>"His love poems are songs of peace, and a deep richly</l>
<l>rewarded surrender; like M. Verhaeren, perhaps a more</l>
<l>tempestuous soul, he has found in ' marriage, warm and kind,"</l>
<l>more than all the wanderers have found in strange adventures</l>
<l>with stranger souls. That is to say he is one of those wise and</l>
<l>happy men who wish not to taste life but to live it. . Love</l>
<l>lives in these poems—does not hang irresolute between having-</l>
<l>loved and about-to-love. ,</l>

<l>"A [Sterner and; more troubled note is struck in the poems</l>
<l>of war-time ; the stormy music of the drum throbs under all the</l>
<l>silvery harmonies. . And here, the greatest of all Belgian</l>
<l>War-poems, so like and yet so utterly unhke a song of hate, is</l>
<l>his New Year's Wishes to the German Army.</l>

<l>" Buy, oh buy, that the pipes of the Belgian soldiers may</l>
<l>send up blue wreaths of sacramental smoke—and that you, too,</l>
<l>raay profit, in a subtler way, by the rare perfume of the Muse's</l>
<l>flaming heart, burning on many small altars ! All the offerings</l>
<l>of faith are in this little book."</l>
