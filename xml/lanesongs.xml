<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p>In the stress of a nation's peril some of its greatest songs are born. In the stress of a nation's peril the poet at last comes into his own again, and with clarion call he rouses the sleeping soul of the empire. Prophet he is, champion and consoler.</p>
<p>If in these later times the poet has been neglected, now in our infinite need, in our pride and our sorrow, he is here to strengthen, comfort and inspire. The poet is vindicated.</p>

<p>What can so nobly uplift the hearts of a people facing war with its unspeakable agony as music and poetry? The sound of martial music steels men's hearts before battle. The sound of martial words inspires human souls to do and to endure. God, His poetry, and His music are the Holy Trinity of war.</p>

<p>Not always the greatest songs that have sent men on to victory. Sometimes it has been a modest verse  that  has   found  refuge   in  the  heart   of   the

soldier ready for the ultimate sacrifice, cheered on his way by the lilt of a humble song. Who else,indeed, can take the place of a poet ?</p>

<p>As Mr. William Watson has most nobly said :</p>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>" Empires dissolve and peoples disappear :</l>
<l>Song passes not away.</l>
<l>Captains and conquerors leave a little dust,</l>
<l>And kings a dubious legend of their reign ;</l>
<l>The swords of Caesars, they are less than rust:</l>
<l>The poet doth remain."</l></lg></q>

<head>PUBLISHER'S NOTE</head>

<p>Of our poets who have been inspired to write and publish separate volumes of war poems during the actual progress of a campaign, we can only recall one--the late Sydney Dobell, whose " Sonnets on the War," and " England in Time of War," both dealt with the Crimea. Mr. William Watson's "The Purple East" was read and quoted the world over during the Armenian atrocities : indeed, " Abdul the Damned " has passed into the language. Although this famous sonnet sequence sprang out of events which could not be called a campaign in the accepted and legitimate sense of the word, yet it may be fairly argued that the Kaiser has surpassed the Turk in inflicting suffering on defenceless people.</p>

<p>Doubtless, however, some of the many poets writing during the present war will in the course of time collect their verses and issue them as independent volumes.</p>



<pb n="viii                                  PUBLISHER'S NOTE"/>

<p>Anthologies also there are, without number, of poems of war on land and sea ; but none of these, so far as I can discover, has been formed during the conflict itself. In this respect, therefore, this collection is unique. I am proposing to issue a series of these volumes during the progress of this great war, dealing with its outstanding events. The next will include a number of poems that have appeared in American and Canadian papers, and will thus have a peculiar interest as expressing the feelings of our kinsmen beyond the sea. All the profits derived from the sale of these anthologies will be given to the Prince of Wales's Fund. Perhaps,therefore, in the event of similar collections being made, it would generally be well if the poet would prevent any possible overlapping by consenting to his poem's appearance in one collection only. In this way the public may be induced to buy the various collections rather than any particular one.</p>

<p>Viscount Dillon sends me the following, taken from <hi rend="italic">La France du Nord</hi> of August 23. These lines, by a poetic ally, who remains anonymous, are as correct in feeling as they are ingenious in adapting themselves to the rhythm of our own National Anthem.</p>

<head>THE ANSWER</head>

<p>[" . . It would be a disgrace for us to make this bargain with Germany at the expense of France, a disgrace from which the good name of this country would never recover."--SIR EDWARD GREY to SIR E. GOSCHEN.]</p>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>WHEN Honour on her silver bugle blows a point of war</l>
<l rend="inline">Then Englishmen arise</l>
<l rend="inline">With battle in their eyes,</l>
<l>They can  only give  one  answer,  as  their  fathers answered, for</l>
<l rend="inline">The choice that they are making</l>
<l rend="inline">Is fighting or forsaking,</l>
<l>And a false, fair-weather friendship is a lie that they abhor.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>O'er the narrow seas the Gallic cock was crowing shrill alarms,</l>
<l rend="inline">He saw them coming forth,</l>
<l rend="inline">The War Lords of the North,</l>

<pb n="16        THE ANSWER"/>

<l>He said--" My little soldiers, it is time to fall to arms;</l>
<l rend="inline">But our coasts are lying bare,</l>
<l rend="inline">Will England do her share ?</l>
<l>A friendship that is fickle is the worst of Fortune's harms.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>" Through Luxemburg and Belgium they are marching in their might,</l>
<l rend="inline">They trample on the weak,</l>
<l rend="inline">Our overthrow to seek ;</l>
<l>They tear up every treaty, and they laugh at every right;</l>
<l rend="inline">Will England see her name</l>
<l rend="inline">Put thus to open shame?</l>
<l>Will she see her Royal pledges torn in pieces in her sight ? "</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>But the  Germans  in   their arrogance   our   Minister addressed,</l>
<l rend="inline">Half-wheedling, half-commanding--</l>
<l rend="inline">" Let us make an understanding,</l>
<l>Her coasts we will not batter nor her ports will we invest;</l>
<l rend="inline">If you will stand apart</l>
<l rend="inline">While we pierce her to the heart,</l>
<l>We will let you show your friendship by a bargain for the rest."</l></lg>


<pb n="THE ANSWER       17"/>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then Sir Edward Grey replied, to the honour of his race--</l>
<l rend="inline">To what England puts her hand,</l>
<l rend="inline">Upon that she takes her stand,</l>
<l>She will not barter treaties in your German market-place,</l>
<l rend="inline">Nor will she condescend</l>
<l rend="inline">To pledge away a friend,</l>
<l>Such contracting out of danger were  for  ever her disgrace."</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>So o'er the perilous seas to Death or Victory we go,</l>
<l rend="inline">Our sailors rushing forth,</l>
<l rend="inline">To give battle in the North;</l>
<l>There as it was aforetime our ships will meet the foe;</l>
<l rend="inline">And our brave soldiers too--</l>
<l rend="inline">The Baltic, Waterloo</l>
<l>As then so now, twice armed are we since Honour backs the blow !</l></lg>

<l rend="inline">Upon him from Li&#x00E8;ge a leaden hail.</l>
<l>All Belgium flew up at his throat in flame,</l>
<l rend="inline">Till at her gates amazed his legions quail!</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Take heed, for now on haunted ground thy tread ;</l>
<l rend="inline">There bowed a mightier War-Lord to his fall ;</l>
<l>Fear!  Lest that very grass again grow red</l>

<l>HE moors the skiff within the cooler gloom</l>
<l>Of river-branches, unaware of doom ;</l>
<l>Cushioned he lolls, and looks in faces fair,</l>
<l>Nursing with placid hand anointed hair.</l>
<l>It seems he scarcely can uplift the weight</l>
<l>Of summer afternoon, far less of fate.</l>
<l>So the young Briton, sprawling in his strength,</l>
<l>Supports a heavy Sabbath at full length,</l>
<l>Till sinks the sun on more than that sweet river,</l>
<l>Perhaps upon our day goes down for ever.</l>
<l>But though that orb may on an Empire set,</l>

<head>GHOSTS AT BOULOGNE</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>ONE dreamer, when our English soldiers trod</l>
<l>But yesterday the welcoming fields of France,</l>
<l>Saw war-gaunt shadows gathering stare askance</l>
<l>Upon those levies and that alien sod--</l>
<l>Saw Churchill's smile, and Wellington's curt nod,</l>
<l>Saw Harry with his Crispins, Chandos' lance,</l>
<l>And the Edwards on whose breasts the leopards dance:</l>
<l>Then heard a gust of ghostly thanks to God</l>
<l>That the most famous quarrel of all time</l>
<l>In the most famous friendship ends at last;</l>
<l>Such flame of friendship as God fans to forge</l>
<l>A sword to strike the Dragon of the Slime,</l>
<l>Bidding St. Denis with St. George stand fast</l>
<l>Against the Worm.    St. Denis and St. George!</l></lg>
