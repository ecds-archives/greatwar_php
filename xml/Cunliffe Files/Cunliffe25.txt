THE AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS

Neutral! America, you cannot give
<l rend="indent">To your sons' souls neutrality. Your powers 
Are sovereign, Mother, but past histories live
<l rend="indent">In hearts as young as ours.

We who are free disdain oppression, lust
<l rend="indent">And infamous raid. We have been pioneers 
For freedom and our code of honor must
<l rend="indent">Dry and not startle tears.

We've read of Lafayette, who came to give
<l rend="indent">His youth, with his companions and their powers, 
To help the Colonies -- and heroes live
<l rend="indent">In hearts as young as ours!

Neutral! We who go forth with sword and lance,
<l rend="indent">A little band to swell the battle's flow, 
Go willingly, to pay again to France
<l rend="indent">Some of the debt we owe.
##-- Marie Van Vorst.

THE CONSCRIPT

Then former stars were faint and signs were fled.
<l rend="indent">Dawn flamed and sleepers roused: you saw men's souls
<l rend="indent">Crowned of that fire with terrible aureoles. 
You saw -- and hid your head, and hid your head. 
What of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, O Unwilling, shall be said? 
<l rend="indent6"<hi rend="italic">>England, Beloved</hi>,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Say that Pain crowned even mine with all men's souls</hi>.

Joyous as guest unto the rose-heaped board,
<l rend="indent">Dreamful as lover to his dreams' desire,
<l rend="indent">Steadfast as martyr to the pitiless fire, 
My sons, yet not to any task abhorred, 
But to love's service, went with one accord. 
<l rend="indent6"><hi rend="italic">No less, Beloved</hi>,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">My heart perforce shall kindle at thy fire</hi>.

Toiled in my vineyard since the early sun,
<l rend="indent">Toiled through the drouth, the ardent heat of noon,
<l rend="indent">These, my true laborers. Say, who earns my boon,
<pb n="275"/>
My honorable wage, my deep Well-done, 
He that shall come at rise or set of sun? 
<l rend="indent6"><hi rend="italic">Even he, Beloved</hi>,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Who serves thee there, whether at eve or noon</hi>.

The marriage-feast was spread within my house,
<l rend="indent">Red flowed the wine, loud rose the eager din.
<l rend="indent">Prepared for honored guests, the fare therein 
Now bids another company carouse. 
O heedless, find you welcome in my house? 
<l rend="indent6"><hi rend="italic">Even I, Beloved</hi>,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Compelled from hedge and highway to come in</hi>.

Renownless Christs of a new Calvary,
<l rend="indent">My children died, love's dearest debt to pay.
<l rend="indent">Thief, who have filched your peace in vain, to-day 
Beside that ransoming love unforced and free, 
Perish you not on a most shameful tree? 
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Not so, Beloved</hi>,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">For I shall meet thy Dead in heaven to-day</hi>.
##-- Alberta Vickridge.

IN A SLUM

I never heard him speak a kindly word,
<l rend="indent">My tears were answered with a savage oath,
He drank what we could very ill afford,
<l rend="indent">He was a bully and a drunkard both.

He broke my body as he broke my soul,
<l rend="indent">I shivered when I heard his stumbling feet;
At times the very household "sticks" he stole,
<l rend="indent">To pawn and pay for women in the street.

I stitched and labored for his children's bread,
<l rend="indent">Fourpence a shirt the sweated wage I earned,
Save when the doctor forced me to my bed,
<l rend="indent">Where thrice a mother's travail I had learned.

The day he left me for the barrack square,
<l rend="indent">He swore we women were no earthly use
For anything but filling men with care,
<l rend="indent">His parting words were words of foul abuse.

And now they tell me of a hero's death,
<l rend="indent">How one to twelve he held the Huns at bay,
And won the Cross, yet with his passing breath
<l rend="indent">He bade the chaplain "take his face away."

<pb n="277"/>
Inside the pubs the neighbors speak his praise,
<l rend="indent">The man who brought the world about our slum, 
Or by the open door they stand and gaze,
<l rend="indent">And wonder why his slattern wife is dumb.

The preacher dwells the ways of God upon,
<l rend="indent">Surpassing man's design and woman's wit; 
Oh God, I can't be sorry he is gone,
<l rend="indent">But going I am glad he did his bit.

ENGLAND TO DENMARK
$$August, 1915

Great little land, old comrades of the sea, 
<l rend="indent">Salt of its salt, whelps of its Viking brood, 
<l rend="indent">Sharers with us in its free fearless mood,
Narrow your home, world-wide your chivalry!
Now call we kin for the past and the years to be, 
<l rend="indent">Now is the name of righteous Cnut renewed, 
<l rend="indent">Forgiven and forgot all days of feud,
In your sure aid and swift sweet sympathy.

Your forbears ruled us with the wise King's yoke, 
<l rend="indent">Your Princess binds us with her Queenly grace, 
<l rend="indent4">To-day your strong sons all our hearts constrain,
Who could not brook a foul and dastard stroke, 
<l rend="indent">But swept between, and rather death would face,
<l rend="indent4">Than that sea-murder Danish waves should stain.
##-- Herbert Warren.

MOTHER OF NATIONS 
$$WHY?

Does the Mother of Nations draw the sword
<l rend="indent">To rescue her children oppressed?
They have all that the richest lands afford;
They sit content at an ample board
<l rend="indent">As safe as a bird in its nest.

Has she laid her spear on the shield of Mars
<l rend="indent">New lands in the wars to gain?
Her dominions extend wherever the stars
Are blushing with shame for our foolish wars;
<l rend="indent">Her ships are on every main.

And not that the world may acclaim her grand
<l rend="indent">Is the roar of her guns on the seas;
Her name is lustred on every strand, 
Her glory is known to the farthest land
<l rend="indent">Where her standard floats on the breeze.

Ah this is the pillar of cloud and fire
<l rend="indent">That leads her hosts along;
This, this is the goal of their deep desire, 
The road where their feet shall never tire, --
<l rend="indent">To be just, keep faith and be strong.

<pb n="280"/>
So the Mother of Nations has risen in might 
<l rend="indent">At the word of the onward call;
She has shaken her banners forth to the light,
And marched to the front of the people's fight 
<l rend="indent">Like the van of a tidal wall.

And the future shall say of her sons who died 
<l rend="indent">Wherever their feet have trod
With millions of comrades in arms allied;
"They cast the treasures of earth aside 
<l rend="indent">And marched to the goals of God."

OUR MEN

Our men, they are our stronghold, 
<l rend="indent">Our bastioned wall unscaled,
Who, against Hate and Wrong, hold
<l rend="indent">This Realm that never quailed;
Who bear the noblest burden
<l rend="indent">Life lays on shoulders broad,
Asking not fame or guerdon,
<l rend="indent">Asking not gold or laud.

They go where England speeds them;
<l rend="indent">They laugh and jest at Fate.
They go where England needs them
<l rend="indent">And dream not they are great,
And oft, 'mid smoke and smother
<l rend="indent">By blinding warstorm fanned
Sons of our mighty Mother,
<l rend="indent">They fall that she may stand.

Our sailors, save when sleeping 
<l rend="indent">The light sleep of the sea,
Their ancient watch are keeping,
<l rend="indent">Mother, for thine and thee!
<pb n="282"/>
They guard thy maiden daughters
<l rend="indent">From worse than death or pain;
The men who ward the waters,
<l rend="indent">The men who man the main.

When navies meet and wrestle,
<l rend="indent">And their vast arms strike home --
Vessel with monstrous vessel
<l rend="indent">Matched on the flame-lit foam --
What fleet returns in glory?
<l rend="indent">What fleet makes haste to fly?
O Sea, that knowest our story,
<l rend="indent">Thou, thou canst best reply!

Then hail to all who gave us
<l rend="indent">Their might of arm and soul,
Hot and athirst to save us,
<l rend="indent">To heal, and keep us whole;
Whether they serve where yonder
<l rend="indent">Far-burrowing trenches run,
Or where the ocean thunder
<l rend="indent">Peals with the thundering gun.
##-- William Watson.
