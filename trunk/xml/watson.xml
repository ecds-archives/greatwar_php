<head>PREFACE</head>

<p>TWICE in his lií'e the author of this little book has had the experience, so painful to a patriotic man, of difFering from the majority of his countrymen on the moral issues involved in certain large and complex questions of international or imperial policy. In both cases he recorded his views and feelings very unambiguously in verse, incurring not a little odium and losing some friends. In both cases public opinion has since moved round into a position fundamentally much nearer his own than it had at first occupied. During the present war, with all its agonies and horrors, he has had at any rate the one private satisfaction of feeling not even the most momentary doubt or misgiving as to the perfect righteousness of his country's cause. There is nothing on earth of which he is more certain than that this Empire, throughout this supreme ordeal, has shaped her course by the Hght of purest duty. Her way has been the way of the just; and even if it be arguable that a base expediency would have dictated another path--even if it be held that by

acquiescing in the initial assault upon France through Belgium she could have purchased a doubtful and transient safety by a sure and lasting infamy--none but a coward and a knave would at any time have counselled so hateful a bargain.</p>

<p>The author owes much to Germany. Though he cannot use her tongue, he has been nourished all his life upon her unmatched achievements in an art which speaks a universal language, the art of Music. To many this art perhaps appears non-moral, yet in the works of the greatest Germanic masters of harmony--and in Beethoven most of all--there is a strangely bracing moral quality, a power which seems to arm the soul for its battle with Circumstance. It must be plain that one who has the feeling of profound obligation to Germany which is here confessed could hardly have had any malice aforethought against her when hostilities began. He was in fact one of those Englishmen who were hardest to convince of her evil intentions, till these flamed forth into acts. When she crossed the fateful bourne one of his uppermost feelings was a purely human regret that a people whose spirit had helped and fed his own should have now taken their irrevocable stand against tlie forces of light and growth and ascension.</p>

<p>The contents of this volume include little that can be described as poems of action. The author

desires his book to be considered as an intermittent commentary on the main developments, and some of the collateral phenomena, of the war. Respecting the arrangement of the poems he feels that a word of apology is due to the reader. Almost the last written is placed íîrst; and though the contents of each separate section of the book are in the main arranged chronologically, the sections themselves pretend to no such order, but are really concurrent, not sequent. He regrets the resulting interruptions of continuity, but they were forced upon him as perhaps the lesser of two evils by the following considerations. Twenty-four of the poems are sonnets. That is to say, they are cast in a mould which, when used in the spirit and tradition of its stricter masters from Milton onwards, is not a loose aggregation of lines which chance to be fourteen in number, but one of the most rigorously exacting  poetic forms; a form usually demanding from him who employs it no little mental concentration, and enjoining upon him a certain artistic asceticism such as forbids his being seduced into mere by-play of thought or emotion. This came to be rather generally understood amongst us in the early "'eighties," when the history of various poetic vehicles or instruments was perhaps more discussed than in later years; but at the present time it is quite a common thing for a sonnet to be referred

to vaguely as its writer's "lines" on this or that, thus showing that whatever special labours may have gone to its shaping have been largely or entirely lost upôn the preoccupied critic. A poet has a duty towards the offspring of his brain, even as toward the heirs of his body; and it is out of a perhaps pardonable regard for their interests and welfare, and as far as possible to secure for them their reasonable dues, that the author has thought fît to detach the sonnets in this volume from their companion poems, and give them a place apart. To dwell, though but for a moment, upon a matter so intensely literary, and at the same time so narrowly personal, may to some readers appear unseemly in a book concerned with the stupendous events now convulsing the world, and written under their shadow; but " Peace hath her victories," and even Poetry her toils, and the latter are not among the least arduous of human efforts.</p>

<p>It only remains for him to add that although many of these poems have already appeared--some of them under now-abandoned titles--in various newspapers, periodicals, and other publications,<ref target="viii">1</ref> the

editors of which are here thanked for permission to reprint them, not a few have since undergone a process for which " revision" would be a feeble word. Indeed, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that in numerous cases the version originally published was little more than the ground-plan of what is offfered in the ensuing pages.</p>

<head>THE MAN WHO SAW</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>THE master weavers at the enchanted loom</l>
<l rend="inline"> Of Legend, weaving long ago those tales</l>
<l>Through which there wanders the grey thread of truth,</l>
<l>Lost in the gorgeous arras of romance,</l>
<l>Tell how King Vortigern resolved to build</l>
<l>A Tower of Safety, mid the solitudes</l>
<l>That are the hem of the great druid robe</l>
<l>Of Snowdon, Mount of Eagles.  So each day</l>
<l>The builders laboured, marrying stone to stone ;</l>
<l>But ever in the night an adversary</l>
<l>Invisible as malevolent cancelled those</l>
<l>Cold nuptials, and with impish wanton rage</l>
<l>Shattered the walls. And thither, from beyond</l>
<l>That congress of grave mountains, met like seers</l>
<l>And bards august, though in a rivalry</l>
<l>Of silence rather than of song--from where</l>
<l>The vales are not so tranced with awe, nor yet</l>
<l>So far below the hilltops as to feel</l>
<l>Aching estrangement--fortune one day brought</l>
<l>A youth whose very brow was a command.</l>


<pb n="18           THE  MAN  WHO  SAW"/>

<l>His name of Merlin had not clambered then</l>
<l>To fearsome greatness, like a dusky star ;</l>
<l>Yet ev'n thus early his subduing eyes</l>
<l>Seemed to have known all things in life but tears ;</l>
<l>And standing where wrecked hopes bestrewed the ground,</l>
<l>He said to them whose toil was shards and dust:</l>
<l>" Go search beneath your tower's foundations ; there</l>
<l>Are the Unbuilders, busy while you build ;</l>
<l>The Undoers are there." And every man obeyed.</l>
<l>And digging deep, they found a hollow abysm,</l>
<l>Where waters gnawed the ribs of the Earth, and sapped</l>
<l>Her sinews, till her frame tottered infirm ;</l>
<l>Where also monsters heaved their tumid bulk</l>
<l>In ancient ambush, and with tremors vast</l>
<l>Palsied those ramparts as they yearned to rise :</l>
<l>Blind dragon shapes, of blindest darkness born,</l>
<l>That save in darkness could not live an hour,</l>
<l>And, touched by Light, made their dull moan, and died.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="inline">Such is the tale, which one, who chronicled</l>
<l>Old shadowy wars in sanctuaries of peace,</l>
<l>Found amid crumbled pomps, the hushed domain</l>
<l>Of mildew, and the empire of the moth,</l>
<l>Nigh on eight hundred years ago.  And now,</l>
<l>Out of that land where Snowdon night by night</l>

<pb n="THE MAN WHO  SAW                 19"/>

<l>Receives the confidences of lonesome stars,</l>
<l>And where Carnarvon's ruthless battlements</l>
<l>Magnificently oppress the daunted tide,</l>
<l>There comes--no fabled Merlin, son of mist,</l>
<l>And brother to the twilight, but a man</l>
<l>Who in a time terrifically real</l>
<l>Is real as the time ; formed for the time ;</l>
<l>Not much beholden to the munificent Past,</l>
<l>In mind or spirit, but frankly of this hour;</l>
<l>No faggot of perfections, angel or saint,</l>
<l>Created faultless and intolerable;</l>
<l>No meeting-place of all the heavenlinesses;</l>
<l>But eminently a man to stir and spur</l>
<l>Men, to afflict them with benign alarm,</l>
<l>Harass their sluggish and uneager blood,</l>
<l>Till, like himself, they are hungry for the goal;</l>
<l>A man with something of the cragginess</l>
<l>Of his own mountains, something of the force</l>
<l>That goads to their loud leap the mountain streams.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="inline">And he too comes to bid the builders probe</l>
<l>Deep undemeath the Tower of Safety, lest</l>
<l>A pit lie cavernous and covert there,</l>
<l>A long baulked, ravening emptiness, a grave</l>
<l>That famishes for its expected food.</l>
<l>Nay, in his hands he takes the delver's spade,</l>
<l>Lays bare the hoUow, o'er which to build at all</l>
<l>Were to build woe and ruin, and 'stablishes</l>

<l>A mightier tower, bastioned so broad and firm,</l>
<l>In life, in manhood, and in womanhood,</l>
<l>Founded upon so massy a human rock,</l>
<l>And with such living bulwarks against them</l>
<l>Who first poured death from where the lark strews bliss,</l>
<l>That when, at last, ours shall be Triumph, though</l>
<l>Triumph perhaps too weary to rejoice,</l>
<l>Save with a mournful jubilation--when</l>
<l>Hate shall reel back from these embattled walls,</l>
<l>And having spent so long its hurtling bolts</l>
<l>With such poor thrift, shall stand before the stars</l>
<l>Bankrupt of thunder--then indeed shall Time</l>
<l>Add yet another name to those the world</l>
<l>Salutes with an obeisance of the soul:</l>
<l>The name of him, the man of Celtic blood,</l>
<l>Whom Powers Unknown, in a divine caprice,</l>
<l>Chose and did make their instrument, wherewith</l>
<l>To save the Saxon : the man all eye and hand,</l>
<l>The man who saw, and grasped, and gripped, and held.</l>
<l>Then shall each morrow with its yesterday</l>
<l>Vie, in the honour of nobly honouring him,</l>
<l>Who found us lulled and blindfold by the verge</l>
<l>Of fathomless perdition and haled us back.</l>
<l>And poets shall dawn in pearl and gold of speech,</l>
<l>Crowning his deed with not less homage, here</l>
<l>On English ground, than yonder whence he rose:</l>

<pb n="THE MAN WHO  SAW                21"/>

<l>Yonder where crash the cataracts through the chasms,</l>
<l>And unto the dark tempests the dark hills</l>
<l>Offer their stubborn sides all gored, but keep</l>
<l>A heart invincible and impregnable;</l>
<l>While with long arm and piercing spear the sea</l>
<l>Thrusts far into the valleys, that of old</l>
<l>Heard the twin raptures of the harp and sword,</l>
<l>The heroic strife, and the heroic strings,</l>
<l>Amid the battling torrents, and beneath</l>
<l>The happier peaks, that without strife, prevail.</l>

<l>Who, in the very whirlwind of our woe,</l>
<l>From midnight tiU the laggard dawn began,</l>
