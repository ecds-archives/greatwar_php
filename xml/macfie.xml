<l>SPINNING in space, a filmy cloudlet shone</l>
<l>Festooned and frayed,</l>

<l>As tenuous ghosts that in the saffron dawn</l>
<l>Upon the sweltry banks of Acheron</l>
<l>Swither and sway. And ever and anon</l>
<l>Out of the margin of the mist there came</l>
<l>Flurries of flame</l>
<l>And drifts of scarlet scud,</l>
<l>As if of glairy tears, and clotted blood,</l>
<l>Together spun--</l>
<l>Spindrift and spume of the vortiginous surge</l>

<l>Came from volcano-throats the raucous roar</l>
<l>Of lava and of thunder; and the shore</l>
<l>Reverberated with the ponderous tide</l>

<l>A genial flush of warmth come burning through</l>

<l>ETERNITY is throned upon thy spires:</l>

<l>Thou wert conceived in the eternal fires</l>
<l>Of the sun's womb: upon the sun's white breast</l>
<l>Wert carried ere the souls of men were made--</l>
<l>Nay, in the nebula the seed was sown</l>

<l>And by the stars were thy foundations laid.</l>
<l>The fire-mist held thee ere the sun it bore;</l>
<l>The sun had presage of thee ere she hurled</l>
