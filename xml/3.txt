<l n="1">M<hi rend="smallcaps">y</hi> sea-winds I gather, my fields I fill</l>
<l>With life-giving roots and grain.</l>
<l>My sons I unite for my greatest fight</l>
<l>My dream and desire to gain.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My land I have clothed in its fairest garb,</l>
<l>Corn-yellow and green and blue.</l>
<l>I arise in my pride, once more to decide</l>
<l>In the conflict of false and true.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I summon to battle from plain and hill,</l>
<l>From woodland and fen and dale,</l>
<l>From my reeking towns and greyhound downs</l>
<l>My men to be cast in the scale.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My flesh still quivers. The poisoned barb</l>
<l>By treacherous foe is flung.</l>
<l>I have plucked it out; my children shout</l>
<l>Of the vengeance to be wrung.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="50"/>
<l>But I seek no vengeance, nor demand</l>
<l>An eye for an eye, nor tooth</l>
<l>For tooth. I desire to raise from the mire</l>
<l>My vision of peace and truth.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I have cleansed the seas, and have opened them</l>
<l>To traffic of many ships:</l>
<l>I would purge the land with the same firm hand</l>
<l>To let peace know no eclipse.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My dreams are challenged. I make my stand.</l>
<l>My vision shall still prevail.</l>
<l>From my white tower I send my power</l>
<l>Arrayed in its proven mail.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>No glory I covet, nor diadem,</l>
<l>Save honour and peace of soul,</l>
<l>But to see far-flung as my singers have sung</l>
<l>My Freedom from pole to pole.</l></lg>

<l n="1">L<hi rend="smallcaps">ived</hi> in days of old a nation</l>
<l>Stark and sturdy, valiant-hearted,</l>
<l>Rich in honest, kindly manhood,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Rich in tender womanhood;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Rich in deft and cunning craftsmen,</l>
<l>Singers mighty and melodious,</l>
<l>Thinkers of sublimest stature --</l>
<l rend="indent4">Masters of the undaunted mind;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Rich -- yea, richest -- in titanic</l>
<l>Wondrous harmony-compellers,</l>
<l>Weaving descants world-enthralling,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Echoes of the voice of God.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But, alas! and in an evil</l>
<l>Day for them, this glorious people</l>
<l>Went a-wandering after idols,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Went a-worshipping false gods.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="54"/>
<l>One grim Idol in especial,</l>
<l>One colossal Moloch-image,</l>
<l>Moulded of blood-tempered iron,</l>
<l rend="indent4">They erected in their midst.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Dark and sinister its aspect,</l>
<l>Rigid, menacing, inhuman,</l>
<l>From its swooping helmet-eagle</l>
<l rend="indent4">To its trailing sabre-tip.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Shaggy brows o'erhung and shaded</l>
<l>Eyes of cynical clairvoyance</l>
<l>Into all the baser instincts</l>
<l rend="indent4">Of the shivering, thrall-bound soul:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Stone-blind to the far horizons</l>
<l>Of the aspiring human spirit:</l>
<l>Stone-blind to the dawning promise</l>
<l rend="indent4">Of a wiser, happier age.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Rose the bullet-head defiant</l>
<l>From aggressive, padded shoulders;</l>
<l>On the breast a steely corslet</l>
<l rend="indent4">Bastioned a stony heart.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="55"/>
<l>Planted firm on mighty jack-boots</l>
<l>Stood the rugged, rough-hewn image --</l>
<l>Seven-league jack-boots, swift to trample</l>
<l rend="indent4">Homes, and hearts, and plighted faith.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Once this god -- so ran the legend --</l>
<l>Led his chosen folk to triumph --</l>
<l>Triumph, dear-bought, triumph tragic,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Yet resplendent in its day.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Whereupon the people, dazzled</l>
<l>By his blood-red blaze of glory,</l>
<l>Saw in him a Teuton Saviour,</l>
<l rend="indent4">Crucifying, not crucified:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Made of him an ogre-fetish,</l>
<l>A cast-iron Mumbo-Jumbo,</l>
<l>Worshipped in a tortuous ritual</l>
<l rend="indent4">Known as <hi rend="italic">Real-Politik</hi>.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Hierarchies of priests before him</l>
<l>Moved through ponderous <hi rend="italic">Kriegs-Manöver</hi>,</l>
<l>Headed by the Archimandrite</l>
<l rend="indent4">Of the far-famed Mailëd Fist.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="56"/>
<l>O'er the land his spirit brooded:</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Renommieren, Schwadronieren</hi></l>
<l>Were accounted saving graces,</l>
<l rend="indent4">And heel-clicking <hi rend="italic">Schneidigkeit</hi>.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Year by year, in huge battalions,</l>
<l>Were the young men of the nation</l>
<l>At his altar consecrated</l>
<l rend="indent4">To a soulless slavery;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>While on the o'erburdened ocean</l>
<l>Steel-clad monsters hurtled, thundering,</l>
<l>Through unhallowed demon-dances,</l>
<l rend="indent4">To propitiate his ghost.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Nor on his own people only</l>
<l>Weighed his worship like a nightmare --</l>
<l>All the nations needs must pay him</l>
<l rend="indent4">Tribute of their youth and strength.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Every nation at his altar</l>
<l>Needs must bow in sullen thraldom,</l>
<l>Pouring tithes of all their treasure</l>
<l rend="indent4">Into his insatiate maw.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="57"/>
<l>Vainly did they murmur, craving</l>
<l>Some remission of their tribute;</l>
<l>Still the Archimandrite answered,</l>
<l rend="indent4">"<hi rend="italic">Real-Politik</hi> forbids!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Till at last, in fierce rebellion</l>
<l>Rose his victims, over-driven,</l>
<l>Rose against the Archimandrite</l>
<l rend="indent4">And his <hi rend="italic">schneidig</hi> hierarchy,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Saying, "Let us smash the Idol,</l>
<l>Pulverize the Moloch-image,</l>
<l>Exorcize the accursëd vampire --</l>
<l rend="indent4">From its menace free the world:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Free ourselves, and free the noble,</l>
<l>Richly dowered, <hi rend="italic">gemütlich</hi> nation,</l>
<l>Doomed by some malign enchantment</l>
<l rend="indent4">To this dire idolatry:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Free the workers, thinkers, singers,</l>
<l>To their saner selves restore them,</l>
<l>Save their souls, reclaim their genius</l>
<l rend="indent4">For the service of mankind."</l></lg>
