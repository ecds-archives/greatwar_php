<l>"This volume, compiled with admirable taste and discrimination by</l>
<l>Mr. Galloway Kyle, is the work of soldiers who are also singers. How</l>
<l>sweet their song it needs but a cursory glance through its pages to</l>
<l>reveal. The poems are the reflections of various temperaments, but</l>
<l>they are all informed by the spirit of a high resolve and a dauntless</l>
<l>courage. There is here, too, a certain gaiety of mood which, by some</l>
<l>strange paradox, appears to be one of the compensations of a soldier's</l>
<l>life. Some of these men are now numbered with the slain, but they</l>
<l>have bequeathed to posterity a priceless legacy of song."—New Witness.</l>

<l>Dr. Hugh Walker, Professor of Literature and Philosophy at St.</l>
<l>David's College, Lampeter, in the Welsh Outlook :—</l>

<l>'■^Soldier Poets is nearly always distinctly good, and sometimes it</l>
<l>comes near to being great poetry. Certainly the spirit that it shows is</l>
<l>great; There are not infrequent technical flaws : how could it be</l>
<l>otherwise when some, probably many, of the pieces were composed in</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>the trenches ? But there is the stark sincerity of purpose, the flawless</l>
<l>truth which has been the essence of great art ever since art arose among</l>
<l>men. Though sonje of the pieces are faulty, they are all tingling with</l>
<l>vitality. They are in touch with reality, yet are nobly free from that</l>
<l>realism which thinks a stench more real than a perfume, and the</l>
<l>polluted slime vvhere a river rolls to the sea through some great city</l>
<l>more real than the infinite ocean beyond.</l>

<l>" These poems from the land of the sights and smells of death are as</l>
<l>wholesome as a new-mown hayfield. And they are so because the</l>
<l>realities the soldiers have fixed their eyes upon are the great realities</l>
<l>of life and death. • I have tried to picture some thoughts that pass</l>
<l>through a man's brain when he dies,' writes Streets—alas ! 'Wounded</l>
<l>and missing, July, 1916.' The man who so tries can never do ignobly.</l>
<l>The vision Streets sees is a reality more enduring than the stench or</l>
<l>the slime. It is Youth thrilling to give for Liberty ' its love, its hope,</l>
<l>its radiant morn.'</l>

<l>"The soldiers always have something particular to say ; sometimes,</l>
<l>we may be sure, they could not rest until it was said.     Let us end with</l>
<l>Captain Grenfell's fine picture of the soldier going into battle.</l>
<l>This is religio militis—not the least noble variety of religion."</l>

<l>" To read these poems by men of all ranks in the British Army is</l>
<l>to weep. But let not the reader deceive himself by tears. It is easy</l>
<l>to weep—and feel safe. Tears will little avail us who profit by the</l>
<l>brotherly sacrifice of these splendid youths if our emotions do not react</l>
<l>in effort.             The soldier poet never dwells on horror for horror's</l>

<l>sake. He knows what life is, and he finds in it beauty and love even</l>
<l>in the depths of pain. The old style of soldier was inarticulate.</l>
<l>Poets as far apart as Tennyson and Kipling tried to sing for him. They</l>
<l>sang well, but the poverty of their effort can only be measured by such</l>
<l>wonderful soldier verses as these. When the soldier himself sings</l>
<l>there is no flamboyance, no mock heroic. He uses a language simple,</l>
<l>direct, sweet. . Here is the secret of the soldier's spirit. We who</l>
<l>cannot fight may be envoisu to learn this secret, but it means travelling</l>
<l>by a hard road.            These men have found the realm beyond the</l>

<l>physical."—The New East (Tokyo).</l>

<l>The national spirit would be fortified if every adult and every</l>
<l>adolescent were acquainted with this book. Order it now and see that</l>
<l>every friend and every school knows about it. A big Public School</l>
<l>edition is in preparation.</l>

<l>Preface</l>

<l>AN Introduction to this second series of " Soldier</l>
<l>,/~\. Poets " is superfluous. What was said hy way of</l>
<l>Foreword to the original volume is equally true of its</l>
<l>successor. There is the less need for repetition because</l>
<l>that original Introduction and the poems that followed</l>
<l>have been the text of many articles, sermons, and speeches,</l>
<l>including an address by the President of the Board of</l>
<l>Education, who allows us to paraphrase his remarks on</l>
<l>the characteristic features, already noted, of the remark¬</l>
<l>able outburst of lyrical poetry from the seat of war.</l>
<l>The poems are remarkedly individual, he pointed out:</l>
<l>they are entirely free from hate and execration. There</l>
<l>is no reviling of the enemy. Our young soldiers look to</l>
<l>poetry as a deliverance from the grim necessities of the</l>
<l>hour rather than as a nieans of expressing martial emotion.</l>
<l>They do not gush concerning patriotism, but they feel it</l>
<l>none the less, and express it soberly, seriously, and with</l>
<l>intense conviction.</l>

<l>The same characteristics, the same yearning over the</l>
<l>beloved country left behind and of tender feeling for</l>
<l>parents and home, are found in all the poems that have</l>
<l>come to us from men in the fighting forces since the</l>
<l>former volume was collected. And here we may repeat,</l>
<l>that while these volumes are typical of the lyrical efflores¬</l>
<l>cence of the fighting men, they do not pretend to be</l>
<l>exhaustive : the larger task of sifting already published</l>
<l>work and compiling a more complete anthology has been</l>
<l>undertaken by a devoted advocate of the significance of</l>
<l>the soldier poets' work and its claim to recognition.</l>

<l>Pfcface</l>

<l>We builded better than we knew when we issued the</l>
<l>original volume as the climax of our proud association</l>
<l>with the soldier poets: it was a greater thing than we</l>
<l>were then aware of. No literary work of our day has</l>
<l>possessed so much genetic force or been of greater in¬</l>
<l>fluence. It was well said that " Soldier Poets " was of</l>
<l>greater service to the Allied cause in America than many</l>
<l>Blue Books and specially prepared statements: it showed</l>
<l>the high clean spirit of ardent, generous youth engaged</l>
<l>on a new Crusade. These songs before sunrise gave fresh</l>
<l>vitality to poetry and were welcomed by a nation on</l>
<l>the eve of rebirth as the promise of a greater intensity</l>
<l>of living, a finer perception of beauty, a clearer vision of</l>
<l>the undying splendour after the weary days in which life</l>
<l>and art had become dreary and meaningless to the multi¬</l>
<l>tude. Now the birth-throes have become more severe,</l>
<l>the spiritual quickening more accentuated, more and</l>
<l>more of the poems are personal threnodies, and the</l>
<l>sentinel graves of the Poetry Review young men who</l>
<l>responded to the call in 1914 now consecrate the long</l>
<l>line from Nieuport to Basra. They are a more glorious</l>
<l>and more numerous company than the Elizabethans, with</l>
<l>whom, in the great comradeship beyond the grave, they</l>
<l>still march, an invisible army, with their brothers-in¬</l>
<l>arms who continue the material and spiritual warfare</l>
<l>here in the flesh, inspiring and directing the fight that</l>
<l>will not end with the war.</l>

<l>Like some great gull on high</l>
<l>Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through</l>
<l>space.</l>

<l>Then do I feel with' God quite, quite alone,</l>
<l>High in the virgin morn, so white and still.</l>

<l>And free from human ill:</l>
<l>My   prayers   transcend   my   feeble   earth-bound</l>

<l>plaints—</l>
<l>As though I sang among the happy Saints</l>

<l>With many a holy thrill—</l>
<l>As  though the glowing sun  were  God's  bright</l>
<l>Throne.</l>

<l>My flight is done.   I cross the line of foam</l>
<l>That breaks around a town of grey and red,</l>

<l>Whose streets and squares lie dead</l>
<l>Beneath the silent dawn—then am I proud</l>
<l>That England's peace to guard I am allowed ;</l>

<l>Then bow my humble head,</l>
<l>In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.</l>

<l>In poverty and misery and toil</l>
<l>Unlit save by a glint of faery spoil</l>

<l>To Courage who, from where our foes embroil.</l>
<l>Still calls us onward—onward tho' the soil</l>
<l>Engulf both us and all that we defend ?</l>

<l>The spoken word holds true :  the swords we wield</l>
<l>Upended show the Cross that, potent yet.</l>
<l>Shall prove each wound we suffer on the field</l>
<l>No sacrifice made vainly to abet</l>
<l>A senseless purpose.   Wait but for the yield</l>
<l>Of all our toil and—God shall not forget.</l>

<l>Death in France</l>

<l>IF I should die while I am yet in France</l>
<l>Before the battle clouds have rolled away,</l>
<l>Give me to feel that death will but enhance</l>
<l>Life's secret vision on its passing day.</l>
<l>Grant then to me new, individual power</l>
<l>In reverie, whilst whimsically I trace</l>
<l>Thro' eager, breathless youth, each pulsing hour.</l>
<l>The light and shadow on its fading face.</l>
<l>And in death's soonest minute let me seek</l>
<l>Life heightened by new splendour, poise, surprise.</l>
<l>New colour flushing deep its paling cheek,</l>
<l>New wonder looking from its tired eyes.</l>
<l>Time's brought a rare patine to old Romance—</l>
<l>Death has an ancient dignity in France.</l>

<l>One girl the less to greet the coming spring.</l>
<l>And pluck the summer's flow'rs.</l>

<l>One less word said aloud.</l>





<l>It is not much :  one prayer the less to God,</l>

<l>The Dream^path</l>

<l>WALKING my dream-paved road on the Hill</l>
<l>of Desire</l>
<l>I saw beneath me the City of Quiet Delight ;</l>
<l>The warming rays from each home-welcoming fire</l>
<l>Wove a pattern of gold on the velvet curtain of</l>
<l>night.</l>

<l>The scent from the hill's rank grass put desire in my</l>
<l>soul</l>

<l>To attain to the City below in the Valley of Hope,</l>
<l>But my grey path led beyond the horizon's roll.</l>

<l>Binding my feet in the web of a dream-made rope.</l>

<l>Reluctant, I followed the path, where I knew was</l>
<l>Pain,</l>
<l>The distance glared with a furnace glow in the</l>
<l>sky.</l>
<l>And the voice of the sea and the splashing of tropic</l>

<l>God</l>

<l>I WENT alone into the fields to-night,</l>
<l>And stood upon the hillside, where the oaks</l>
<l>Have stood and talked of God in the twilight</l>
<l>For centuries, and cracked their ancient jokes</l>
<l>Over our heads;  those veterans know more</l>
<l>Of God than we have learned with all our lore.</l>

<l>I pressed my cheek against an oak's rough bark.</l>
<l>And watched the sun drop down behind the hill;</l>
<l>Silence fell on the valley ; the last lark</l>
<l>Was hushed ; and suddenly the wind was still</l>
<l>A breath of air went rustling through the trees,</l>
<l>And God passed by me in the sunset breeze.</l>

<l>A clock chimed in the valley down below;</l>
<l>Some children shouted ; and the blue smoke curled</l>
<l>Out of the cottage chimneys—'twas as though</l>
<l>There could be nothing ugly in the world ;</l>

<l>The lights gleamed from the houses in the wood ;</l>

<l>And God smiled, for He saw that it was good.</l>

<l>As if the earth groaned at her own disgrace ;</l>

<l>It trembled on the breeze, swelled, and then died;</l>

<l>Again the branches rustled, and God sighed.</l>





<l>Sunset</l>

<l>LIKE a vast forest on some distant plain,</l>
<l>J Out in the west, dark, rounded clouds lay low</l>
<l>Upon the sea :   o'er them, the sun's broad train—</l>
<l>The glories of the golden afterglow.</l>

<l>Gold, and then crimson : changing, through degrees</l>
<l>Of red and green, to fields of turquoise blue :</l>

<l>Then darker blue, that challenges the seas</l>
<l>To deeper darkness, as the storm-clouds do.</l>

<l>Then, when the stars gleamed faintly, blushing red</l>
<l>At their own eagerness :  and as this feast</l>

<l>Of beauty seemed complete, and day was dead,</l>
<l>I turned my face, and looked toward the east.</l>

<l>There I saw that which made me hold my breath ;</l>
<l>I'd thought the sunset fair :  now met my sight,</l>

<l>Her cold and naked beauty, as she threw</l>
<l>Her path of silver moonbeams on the sea.</l>

<l>God showed me then, that, if we learn to love</l>
<l>The beauties that He sends us in our day,</l>

<l>More lovely yet v/ill night celestial prove—</l>

<l>MARTIN  HILL</l>

<l>Corporal, R.A.M.C.</l>

<l>On Seeing the Coast of England from</l>
<l>Boulogne</l>

<l>ALONG low line of polished white</l>
<l>Faintly the cliffs of England gleam,</l>
<l>Now slowly fading out of sight,</l>
<l>Now swiftly leaping back, they seem</l>
<l>Strange joys, strange sorrows to impart.</l>
<l>And voices whisper at my heart.</l>

<l>A quiet wood, a quiet lane.</l>
<l>The song of birds amid the trees.</l>
<l>The splash of sun, the sting of rain,</l>
<l>The warm sweet air, the sighing breeze,</l>
<l>And you beside our cottage door</l>
<l>At eventide.   Dear heart, once more</l>

<l>I see the first faint sunbeam tip</l>
<l>The East with gold, the hills light up.</l>
<l>Or stealing lower softly sip</l>
<l>The dewdrop from the rose's cup ;</l>
<l>The glint of gorse upon the down.</l>
<l>The long ploughed meadow strong and brown.</l>

<l>We wander 'mid the grassfield where</l>
<l>The busy reaper wends his way,</l>
<l>The sharp scythe flashes on the air.</l>
<l>Heavy the scent of new-mown hay</l>
<l>Floats down the breeze, and all around</l>
<l>The stricken poppies strew the ground.</l>

<l>Slowly my half-felt sorrows go</l>
<l>And hope comes, gazing seaward where</l>
<l>The dim cliffs glitter, for I know</l>
<l>That these and you await me there.</l>
<l>And I shall find them dearer far</l>
<l>Enriched by all the pangs of war.</l>





<l>Requiescat</l>

<l>HOW young and bright he was, and when he</l>
<l>laughed</l>
<l>The air around seemed sharing in his joy ;</l>
<l>Fair was the world to him, nor spot nor stain</l>
<l>Of all its hidden ugliness had laid</l>
<l>A mark upon his face (that mark that sears</l>
<l>And brands the souls that know it but too well) ;</l>
<l>But all that's lovely in it lay beneath</l>
<l>The wonder that shone shyly in his eyes.</l>
<l>A child of Nature he, of woods and sunlit ways.</l>
<l>Of rolling meadows where the air was sweet</l>

<l>With new-born blossoms and the scent of hay ;</l>
<l>Of hills and valleys, laughing streams and lakes</l>
<l>Where rustling reeds their whispered secrets told.</l>
<l>All these he knew and loved, they were his friends,</l>
<l>His sole companions, and through them he learnt</l>
<l>To know his mother Nature ;  all her moods</l>
<l>Diverse and strange he learnt them one by one ;</l>
<l>Her summer laughter and her autumn tears.</l>
<l>Her seeming winter harshness and the sweet</l>
<l>Serene repentance of her early spring.</l>
<l>Life was his love, and in her warm soft arms</l>
<l>He freedom found from care, repose and peace.</l>
<l>And finding knew that it sufficed.</l>

<l>And then came War to claim him, dragged him forth.</l>
<l>Forth from his quiet world, and flung him down</l>
<l>Bewildered and amazed, yet unafraid.</l>
<l>The merest cypher in that crowded train.</l>
<l>So hour by hour the meanness of War,</l>
<l>And all its horrors, petty hates and sins</l>
<l>Raged round his struggling head, until the day</l>
<l>A wandering bullet found him, and Death took</l>
<l>Unto himself what Life once held so dear.</l>

<l>His face was smiling when they picked him up</l>

<l>As though he'd learnt his Mother's last great secret</l>

<l>And in learning found all well.</l>

<l>At a Wayside Shrine</l>

<l>THE column halts before a wayside shrine</l>
<l>To change formation into battle line</l>
<l>From double file.   'Tis even, and the sun</l>
<l>Its daily circling race has wellnigh done.</l>
<l>Behind me in the West, a dying glow</l>
<l>Of gold still gleams, to cast a pale halo</l>
<l>Upon the shrine.</l>

<l>How many men before</l>
<l>To-night have halted at this spot, and wore</l>
<l>The same grim, ready look that I see now</l>
<l>Painted on every face from chin to brow.</l>
<l>And in each eye f   One and all are ready</l>
<l>For come what may ; each man now stands steady</l>
<l>Waiting command.</l>

<l>And now the line will pass</l>
<l>The shrine—itself as steady as the mass</l>
<l>Of England's sons slow moving to the fray.</l>
<l>Their Destiny now in the hands of—say.</l>
<l>The dim Divinity within that shrine—</l>
<l>A loving God (the stricken Christ His sign</l>
<l>Of Love)—or what ?</l>

<l>On to some human target, trudging by,</l>
<l>(Dropping it low with sharp surprised cry)</l>
<l>Even as I trudge by.</l>





<l>So have some died</l>

<l>Back in the dawn of time on earth.</l>
<l>Before she brought her sons to birth.</l>
<l>You stood the same- as now you stand—</l>
<l>Untroubled, vast, majestic, grand :</l>

<l>Old Hackpen Hill and Barbury Camp,</l>
<l>Of many an army passing by</l>
<l>Under a blue and cloud-flecked sky.</l>
<l>And happy they who fell in fight</l>

<l>On this sweet earth.   Yet in my daily creed</l>
<l>Shall be deep thanks to War that touched my eyes</l>
<l>With sight to see in you my priceless prize.</l>





<l>Return is sweet to one who hath been far</l>
<l>On pilgrimage or war's stern business, and</l>
<l>Hath oft at evening watched the evening star</l>
<l>Beckon to him beyond the desert sand.</l>
<l>Whispering of those green lands of memory's home,</l>
<l>Fertile with bliss that was and is to be,</l>
<l>Until, no more inconstantly to roam</l>
<l>With a sweet pain at heart then voweth he.</l>
<l>But doubly happy in my happiness</l>
<l>Am I who to anticipate made glad</l>
<l>Drear days of trial, and find each cheerful guess</l>
<l>So true, I gained such glad days from such sad :</l>
<l>You are my home, and I find home confirm</l>
<l>The hopes most glad of my sad exile-term.</l>

<l>And yet if I unto my verse would wed</l>
<l>Fair Truth, who stands with grave unfaltering gaze,</l>
<l>Reading where late my labouring pen hath sped</l>
<l>In halting periods o'er my checkered days.</l>
<l>Let me not write so of the present jo}-</l>
<l>Of my home-coming that one could infer</l>

<l>A happiness complete, without alloy</l>
<l>Of my sad Knowledge, Wisdom's minister.</l>
<l>Do I not know the bitter tinge to Life</l>
<l>Which Fate hath in your chaliced mother-heart</l>
<l>Mixed with maternal sweetness—the sharp knife</l>
<l>That stabs your peace—the cloud that doth impart</l>
<l>A darkness to each day—a child's affliction,</l>
<l>* Bounding your every joy with stern restriction ?</l>

<l>True, true it is I know your suffering, dear.</l>
<l>And that my knowledge never can attain</l>
<l>To utter understanding nor come near</l>
<l>With Sympathy your heights of holy pain.</l>
<l>Yet to be comforted you'll not refuse,</l>
<l>Knowing your Mother's heart can mine relieve ;</l>
<l>So take this comfort: that your son will use</l>
<l>The gifts you gave him homage due to give</l>
<l>Unto your humble greatness—never pray</l>
<l>For richer boon than grace to sow these seeds</l>
<l>Of future fame, to tell a later day</l>
<l>All the eternal splendour of your deeds.</l>
<l>Thus may I crown a life of little worth</l>
<l>With the rich praise of her who gave me birth.</l>

<l>These gifts you gave on God's behalf, I wonder</l>
<l>How they are mine above all my deserving—</l>
<l>My life's path cluttered is with many a blunder</l>
<l>Nor Duty-guided in a course unswerving,</l>

<l>Upon some summer's breathing breast—nor runes</l>
<l>Around a lonely lake which ripples play.</l>
<l>Falling on quiet shores—nor voice of shimmering</l>

<l>ocean</l>
<l>Whose anger sleepeth.   Nay on all the earth</l>
<l>There is no beauty stirring sweet emotion</l>

<l>Worshipped for fruitful blessings, incense rose,</l>
<l>While the stone altar held the dove just slain</l>
<l>In simple, penitential sacrifice.</l>
<l>And the great congregation, humbled, bowed,</l>
<l>Acknowledged thus the wondrous gifts whose price</l>
<l>They could not pay but in surrender proud</l>
<l>To gratitude's humility.—But you</l>
<l>Claim nothing slain in your cult, except</l>
<l>What I would less than value—all the true,</l>

<l>To match your speed to your soul's quick tune</l>
<l>When there's never a sound to break the magic ;</l>

<l>Are pricking your heart with a fairy goad ?</l>

<l>Stealthily close on your path, till fear</l>

<l>Of their dense bulk looms;   and your heartsick</l>

<l>trembling</l>
<l>Shakes into stillness as you swing clear.</l>
<l>Then the high haw-hedges furious will bide.</l>
<l>Drawing back from the light of the moon :</l>

<l>grass.</l>
<l>Beneath the sun, the tinest leaf hangs still:</l>
<l>The flowers in languor droop, and tired men pass</l>

<l>All somnolent, while death whines loud and shrill.</l>
<l>O fine, full-throated choir invisible.</l>

<l>Whose sudden burst of rapture fills the ear !</l>
<l>Are ye insensible to mortal fear.</l>

<l>That such a stream of melody ye spill,</l>
<l>While murk of battle drifts on Auber's hill,</l>
<l>And mankind dreams of slaughter ?   What wild glee</l>
<l>Has filled your throbbing throats with sound,</l>
<l>until</l>
<l>Its strains are poured from every bush and tree,</l>
<l>And sad hearts swell with hope, and fierce eyes</l>
<l>fill?</l>
<l>The world is stark with blood and hate—but ye—</l>
<l>Sing on !   Sing on ! in careless ecstasy.</l>

<l>THE</l>

<l>REBIRTH   OF   POETRY</l>

<l>The Daily Telegraph, in the course of a remarkable leading</l>
<l>article under the abpve heading, on June 12th, said :—</l>

<l>Then came the war, with its strong appeal to chivalry and hardihood</l>
<l>and moral fervour, and our young men responded not only with the</l>
<l>hazard of their lives, but with all the warmth and generosity of deeply</l>
<l>stirred hearts. And then the miracle happened. For many of these young</l>
<l>men, whom the novelty and romance of their lofty enterprise had shaken</l>
<l>out of their habitual reserve and their intellectual shyness, discovered</l>
<l>that they must join also the great army of singers and bards, and that</l>
<l>only by means of poetry could they give expression to all the multiform</l>
<l>emotional experience engendered in their minds by the great Crusade.</l>

<l>So it came about that Poetry was reborn in the throes ofiuar, and that</l>
<l>Mars once more claimed kinship with Apollo and the Muses. Guards¬</l>
<l>men wrote sonnets ; privates composed odes ; corporals and sergeants—</l>
<l>so unlike the non-commissioned officers of the past—relaxed their stern</l>
<l>and practical souls in " soldier songs." The phenomenon is not so</l>
<l>surprising as at first sight it appears, although no one probably foresaw</l>
<l>what large dimensions it would assume. It is only reasonable to</l>
<l>suppose that moments of crisis causing a great emotional strain should</l>
<l>find their issue in verse. Poetry is, after all, the natural outlet for</l>
<l>those who feel deeply, and if hitherto the whole range of feeling and</l>
<l>sentiment has been kept under lock and key, owing to a modesty and</l>
<l>shame-facedness extremely characteristic of Englishmen, it is not</l>
<l>altogether surprising that even those who thought themselves dumb</l>
<l>should at such supreme moments suddenly find a tongue.</l>

<l>Mr. Erskine Macdonald, a publisher who has interested himself</l>
<l>deeply in this department of literature, produced a series of little books</l>
<l>of Georgian verse and Soldier Songs, which have a distinct character of</l>
<l>their own, and often astonish us by their fecundity and their power.</l>
<l>Sometimes, as might be expected, they are a little rough and uncouth ;</l>
<l>sometimes they grate on the aesthetic sense by their deliberate disdain of</l>
<l>beauty ; but they never fail for want of strength. The best of them</l>
<l>come hot from excited brains, and are written by those who have an</l>
<l>actual and vivid experience of what modern warfare means, who know</l>
<l>its squalor and its hideousness, and yet are able to throw round it a</l>
<l>kind of forlorn fascination and charm, thanks to the energy of their</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>own imagination and ancy. Not for them the Wordsworthian dictum</l>
<l>that poetry is " emotion remembered in tranquillity " ; they have had</l>
<l>no time to become tranquil before they poured out their souli in song.</l>

<l>Much of the work may even be destined to last. , Nothing has</l>
<l>been more remarkable than the part which our young men have played</l>
<l>in this world crisis ; nothing which brings home to our minds so vividly</l>
<l>the faith and fervour of the original stock whence they came. Their</l>
<l>great romance has been their actual participation in the war. But in</l>
<l>lesser forms also—by the poetry they have written and the letters they</l>
<l>have sent home—they have given yet another proof of the virile qualities</l>
<l>of our race.</l>
