<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">S<hi rend="smallcaps">hy</hi>, youthful, silent -- and misunderstood</l>
<l>In the white glare of Kinghood thou didst stand.</l>
<l>The sceptre in thy hand</l>
<l>Seemed but a flower the Fates had tossed to thee,</l>
<l>And thou wert called, perchance half-scornfully,</l>
<l>Albert the Good.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>To-day thou standest on a blackened grave,</l>
<l>Thy broken sword still lifted to the skies.</l>
<l>Thy pure and fearless eyes</l>
<l>Gaze into Death's grim visage unappalled</l>
<l>And by the storm-swept nations thou art called Albert the Brave.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Tossed on a blood-red sea of rage and hate</l>
<l>The frenzied world rolls forward to its doom.</l>
<l>But high above the gloom</l>
<l>Flashes the fulgent beacon of thy fame,</l>
<l>The nations thou hast saved exalt thy name --</l>
<l>Albert the Great!</l></lg>

<l>Albert the good, the brave, the great, thy land</l>
<l>Lies at thy feet, a crushed and morient rose</l>
<l>Trampled and desecrated by thy foes.</l>
<l>One day a greater Belgium will be born,</l>
<l>But what of this dead Belgium wracked and torn?</l>
<l>What of this rose flung out upon the sand?...</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold! Afar where sky and waters meet</l>
<l>A white-robed Figure walketh on the sea.</l>
<l>(Peace goes before Him and her face is sweet.)</l>
<l>As once He trod the waves of Galilee</l>
<l>He comes again the tumult sinks to rest,</l>
<l>The stormy waters shine beneath His feet.</l>
<l>He sees the dead rose lying in the sand,</l>
<l>He lifts the dead rose in His holy hand</l>
<l>And lays it at His breast.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>O broken rose of Belgium, thou art blest!</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">G<hi rend="smallcaps">rey</hi> broke the light of that Sabbath dawn</l>
<l rend="indent">On the English pickets,</l>
<l>Gold rose the sun o'er the unreaped corn</l>
<l rend="indent">And the Hainault thickets.</l>
<l>Through the park at home, where the young rooks caw'd,</l>
<l>And the dew lay deep on the churchyard sward,</l>
<l>Went Mary, arisen to meet her Lord --</l>
<l>While Mons must be held for England.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Clear broke the day as the bugles blew, --</l>
<l rend="indent">Who shall hear them to-morrow?</l>
<l>Sternly the thunder of Edom grew,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the tally of sorrow.</l>
<l>Right wing, left wing, centre attacked,</l>
<l>Legions launched like a cataract,</l>
<l>But the English stood to their plighted pact, --</l>
<l>Yes, Mons must be held for England!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Pitiless noon, when the screaming shard</l>
<l rend="indent">Left the air acrid.</l>
<l>But they looked on Malplaquet and Oudenarde,</l>
<l rend="indent">So the soil was sacred.</l>
<pb n="57"/>
<l>And they thought (who knows?) on some Surrey lane,</l>
<l>On some mother's kiss, or some school refrain,</l>
<l>And they tightened the girths of their saddles again,</l>
<l>Since Mons must be held for England.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Red set the sun in the angry skies</l>
<l rend="indent">Ere the fight was over.</l>
<l>Fierce were the beams of the cruisers' eyes</l>
<l rend="indent">By the cliffs of Dover.</l>
<l>News -- ill news -- for Namur is lost!</l>
<l>No need for the Eagle to count the cost.</l>
<l>But Mons was the merest hill at the most,</l>
<l>Yet Mons had been held for England.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Lord, Who hast known what a slain Son is,</l>
<l rend="indent">Judge Thou their labor!</l>
<l>Lifted they eyes to the vanities?</l>
<l rend="indent">Deceived their neighbor?</l>
<l>Sift Thou the souls that are utterly Thine,</l>
<l>Clean are those cold hands of covert design;</l>
<l>Silent they lie in their last long line,</l>
<l>Who died to hold Mons for England!</l></lg>

<head rend="center">VISION OF WAR</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<head rend="center">1.</head>
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcaps">went</hi> out into the night of quiet stars;</l>
<l>I looked up at the wheeling heavens, at the mysterious firmament;</l>
<l>I thought of the awful distances out there, of the incredible magnitudes, of space and silence and eternity;</l>
<l>I thought of man, his life, his love, his dream;</l>
<l>I thought of his body, how it is born and grows, and of his spirit that cannot be explained.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>All about me slept the land in peace, and nature slept in deep serenity;</l>
<l>An off-shore wind had died at sunset, the bay was calm and golden as twilight fell;</l>
<l>Not a cloud broke the clear and tender blue of the evening sky.</l>
<l>Then the quiet stars came out, the air grew cool with the breath of night;</l>
<l>A land-breeze flurried, wafting the odor of damp woods and late hay-fields;</l>
<l>A gentle breeze, that scarcely turned the sleeping leaves.</l>
<pb n="59"/>
<l>I walked on through the village, I saw the lights go out in houses as men and women prepared for bed;</l>
<l>Safe and secure, the homes of my neighbors rested in the shadow of tall trees, that had been growing there peacefully a long time;</l>
<l>I passed on into the country, crickets were singing in the fields, fireflies were glimmering in the pastures among low growths of spruce and pine;</l>
<l>I mounted a hill, high overhead brooded the majestic and silent heavens;</l>
<l>On the eastern horizon a great bright star arose, casting a track across the bay.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I have never seen the world so calm, the air so clear and still;</l>
<l>I have never known an hour so full of quietness.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">2.</head>
<l rend="italic">Hour of the War!</l>
<l rend="italic">Now, now -- and here -- on this same earth, and under this same sky!</l>
<l rend="italic">Now! -- Now! -- The War! -- The War! -- The War!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Night, and a sodden field, and starlight over all,</l>
<l>And on the ground the bodies of dead men lying;</l>
<pb n="60"/>
<l>Tumbled, broken, grotesque, in attitudes unhuman, in lumpish, swollen heaps, they lie,</l>
<l>Where death suddenly snatched them up and flung them down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A strange, dark, silent scene;</l>
<l>Here passed the awful charge three days ago;</l>
<l>Here met the choking volley, shattered out and fell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Three days and nights they have been lying here;</l>
<l>No help could reach them, cast between the battle lines;</l>
<l>No help is needed now.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Slowly above their heads the conflict wore itself away;</l>
<l>Calm settled on the shaking, riven air;</l>
<l>The sharp cries of the wounded stopped one by one, their groans grew fainter;</l>
<l>A few crawled off -- the others lay as they had fallen, under the sun and stars;</l>
<l>Then the third night, and peace at last, the quietness restored.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">3.</head>
<l>Listen! -- could one be living? -- come this way;</l>
<l>Here where a score of bodies are drawn mysteriously together,</l>
<l>A turning face catches a gleam of starlight,</l>
<l>A hand moves, winnowing the air.</l>
<pb n="61"/>
<l><hi rend="italic">"Water!"</hi> -- No use, no use -- too late;</l>
<l>His breast is shot away -- don't move him -- God, how he bled!</l>
<l>What is it, comrade? A letter -- make a light:</l>
<l rend="italic">"We have not heard since you left home.... I cannot bear it...."</l>
<l>Turn the sheet over: -- <hi rend="italic">"Oh, my dear, be careful!"</hi></l>
<l>Here is the signature -- the address -- a distant village;</l>
<l>I have been there -- an ancient, quiet village of the north,</l>
<l>Fronting the open sea.</l>
<l>Yes, comrade, I will write -- he smiles:</l>
<l>To lie here, thinking, suffering, remembering;</l>
<l>To be left to die alone!</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">4.</head>
<l>But not alone:</l>
<l>Passing brother, you have yet a grim companion;</l>
<l>Along the edge of the thicket just now, as I went to the brook down there for water,</l>
<l>I stumbled over something that must have been left from the charge a week ago:</l>
<l>A body that held the remnants of a man.</l>
<l>He had dragged himself to the brook, he lay imbedded in tall waving grass;</l>
<l>His stomach had been ripped open by shrapnel, maggots were heaving in the wound</l>
<pb n="62"/>
<l>(Did you know that a man could live while maggots formed in his flesh?)</l>
<l>His muscles twitched convulsively, he was barely conscious;</l>
<l>He did not notice the match I struck, his eyes were filmed over, he would not drink;</l>
<l>The region that he inhabited was an unknown, unimaginable land.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(At home, a woman waits for news of him:</l>
<l>It is well that she can never hear.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">5.</head>
<l>Pass on, pass on! Behold the mobilization of armies;</l>
<l>The men leaving their work at the counter and factory, dropping the plow where it stands in the field,</l>
<l>Flocking together, filling the towns, saying good-by to wife and children, taking a last look around;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold the flinging forward of nations in the wake of armies;</l>
<l>The marvellous, massive engines, the enormous paraphernalia;</l>
<l>The powerful mechanical conveyances, the long lines of them carrying supplies;</l>
<pb n="63"/>
<l>The immense stores of provisions at the depot, the stacks of clothing and other necessities, the huge piles of fodder and grain for the horses;</l>
<l>The flaring illuminations, the sweating gangs working beneath them, ceaselessly receiving, sorting, distributing;</l>
<l>The field guns, the heavy artillery, their ponderous steady movements through the villages;</l>
<l>The stout-wheeled wagons full of dangerous, costly ammunition;</l>
<l>The roaring trains, arriving and departing, some laden with supplies, some packed with humanity, alive or dead;</l>
<l>The vast and systematic commissariat, the grist of war.</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">6.</head>
<l>Behold the columns, advancing, advancing, advancing;</l>
<l>Tramping steadily onward, seen behind on the hills, and seen ahead to the distant turn of the road;</l>
<l>Streaming along the valleys, gaining and crossing the passes, flanking the mountain ranges, netting the land with a lethal web;</l>
<l>Accoutrements flashing and jangling, thunder of tread, regular motion swaying and undulating the lines;</l>
<pb n="64"/>
<l>Countless miles of indomitable marching men;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Behold the front, the million-manned intrenchments, continent-spanning;</l>
<l>The infinite detail of day-works and night-works;</l>
<l>The burrowing, roofing, screening, the placing of barbed-wire entanglements;</l>
<l>The stealthy advance in the darkness, the hasty and desperate digging-in under fire;</l>
<l>The shifting and rushing forward of artillery, the lashing of horses, the running of wires for communication;</l>
<l>The searchlights feeling afar through the night, like cold white fingers;</l>
<l>The life of the trenches, after all is completed;</l>
<l>The hidden underground chambers, the well-concealed passages, the bomb-proof quarters;</l>
<l>The men laughing and singing, some of them making music on simple instruments, some playing cards, some smoking and talking;</l>
<l>Passing backwards and forwards, eating, sleeping, fighting, or taking their leisure, all out of sight, in tunnels and cavities below the surface:</l>
<l>A serious new game for earnest, grown-up children.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Hark, hark! Aloft -- look up;</l>
<l>A great bird sails across the sky, with loud and strident whirr of wings;</l>
<pb n="65"/>
<l>Terribly swift -- a moment -- it is gone.</l>
<l>Can men be passing there on high, so swiftly through the air?)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">7.</head>
<l>Pass on! Behold the charge;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Ready! Run low! Run wide!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l>
<l>Over the open fields, trampling the crops, dropping to fire, rising to run;</l>
<l>(Some never rising, never again to rise;)</l>
<l>Straggling, thinning, wavering, (God, it is hopeless! -- it is too much!)</l>
<l>Onward, onward pressing, rushing and driving onward;</l>
<l>(I did not know that men could be so reckless and brave!)</l>
<l>Mounting the opposite slope, cutting their way through entanglements;</l>
<l>Gaining the outer trenches, (deadly work for the bayonets!)</l>
<l>Shouting, cursing, groaning, stabbing, wrestling, clubbing with butts, fighting at last with bare fists;</l>
<l>Annihilating the enemy, capturing the position!</l>
<l rend="italic">(Victory! Victory! Victory!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l>
<pb n="66"/>
<l>(On the open field lie many huddled shapes;</l>
<l>The wounded are stirring feebly out there, like men awaking from a violent dream;</l>
<l>They lift their heads, they stretch their arms, they struggle to rise on their elbows;</l>
<l>They sit up, staring around -- they crawl like snails among the crops;</l>
<l>A screaming horse dashes athwart the line, dragging his entrails on the ground.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">8.</head>
<l>Behold the ships at sea;</l>
<l>A long and weary time they had been waiting, constantly on the alert, nerves strained to breaking;</l>
<l>In smothering, foggy weather, in gloomy days, in pitch-black nights, in wild and desperate gales;</l>
<l>Anxious for battle, longing to sight the enemy, every one on the lookout, chafing and growling;</l>
<l>Anything, anything, boys, to end this tedious monotony!</l>
<l>(Maybe an unseen deliverer is at hand.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The captain was walking the bridge that morning, the crew were at breakfast, the navigating officer was winding his chronometers;</l>
<l>Suddenly, from forward, a frantic cry! A man runs aft, pointing to windward;</l>
<l>The captain whips out his glasses, scans the horizon;</l>
<pb n="67"/>
<l>For a while, he does not pick up a little white streak on the water, not very far away, drawing rapidly nearer;</l>
<l>A streak like the wake of a shark's fin, cutting along on the weather bow.</l>
<l>He sees it! Quick, to the signal! <hi rend="italic">Stop! Full speed astern!</hi></l>
<l rend="italic">Over, there, with the helm!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Too late, too late, captain of ship and lives;</l>
<l>Away from the little wake springs a broader wake;</l>
<l>A murderous fish drives straight towards you, churning the water as he goes.</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Close compartment doors!</hi> -- the last command;</l>
<l>Then to the end of the bridge, and stand there waiting;</l>
<l>Press tight the lips, fold the arms on the breast, throw back the head:</l>
<l>Below, along the weather rail, a line of men stands silently, watching death come;</l>
<l rend="italic">(Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A whitish object skims on the surface of the blue sea;</l>
<l>The torpedo strikes below the magazine;</l>
<l>The ship is instantly blown in two -- she sinks like lead;</l>
<l>A faint cheer finds no listener but God.</l>
<pb n="68"/>
<l>A few men struggle on the water, where she went down;</l>
<l>They cling for a while to fragments of wreckage;</l>
<l>There is no help in sight -- they cannot be saved.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>(Down in the close, tight shell -- in the unseen, mysterious vessel,</l>
<l>Crouching in a dim chamber, in utter silence, wrapped in impenetrable privacy, apart from life, cut off from world of land and sea,</l>
<l>A man sits, breathing hard, clenching his hands;</l>
<l>Far above him, where sunlight strikes on breaking wave, a secret eye looks out,</l>
<l>A secret mirror throws down to him the story there;</l>
<l>One long, intense, absorbing glance -- then to the signal stretches out his hand;</l>
<l>Turning away, as darkly as she came, the submarine speeds homeward,</l>
<l>Leaving the sea to seal her work and bury her dead.)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">9.</head>
<l>Behold! Hour of the War!</l>
<l>Life everywhere flowing in strange new channels!</l>
<l>The world aroused, awakened! The silence rent! Peace shattered and overthrown!</l>
<l>The well-ordered conventions rudely broken up! The illusions dissipated! The motives suddenly disclosed!</l>
<pb n="69"/>
<l>Men face to face with nature, death, and pain! The elemental shown! And dim and far, the truth appearing!</l>
<l>The hovering dream I The distant and divine conception!</l>
<l>(I sing no battles lost, retreating armies:</l>
<l>O, I tell you, in this campaign there are no defeats!</l>
<l>O, I tell you, the retreating and advancing armies are equally triumphant!</l>
<l>O, I tell you, the lost battles contribute as much as the battles won, to the sure result of this campaign!</l>
<l rend="italic">Victory! Victory! Victory!</l>
<l rend="italic">Our country calls! Our country, and our King!)</l></lg>

<lg>
<head rend="center">10.</head>
<l>While about me sleeps the land in peace, while men and women prepare for bed;</l>
<l>While the land-breeze flurries, wafting a scent of autumn woods and fallen leaves;</l>
<l>While the crickets sing in the fields, and fireflies glimmer among low spruce and pine;</l>
<l>While the bright star rises, casting a track across the bay;</l>
<l>While the majestic heavens wheel onward, overlooking space and time;</l>
<l>While the still air drops down its quietness like love.</l></lg>
