<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">SOMETIMES I fly at dawn above the sea,</l></l>
<l>Where, underneath, the restless waters flow -</l>
<l rend="indent">Silver, and cold, and slow.</l>
<l>Dim in the east there burns a new-born sun,</l>
<l>Whose rosy gleams along the ripples run,</l>
<l rend="indent">Save where the mist droops low,</l>
<l>Hiding the level loneliness from me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And now appears beneath the milk-white haze</l>
<l>A little fleet of anchored ships, which lie</l>
<l rend="indent">In clustered company,</l>
<l>And seem as they are yet fast bound by sleep,</l>
<l>Although the day has long begun to peep,</l>
<l rend="indent">With red-inflam&egrave;d eye,</l>
<l>Along the still, deserted ocean ways.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The fresh, cold wind of dawn blows on my face</l>
<l>As in the sun's raw heart I swiftly fly,</l>
<l rend="indent">And watch the seas glide by.</l>
<pb n="17"/>
<l>Scarce human seem I, moving through the skies,</l>
<l>And far removed from warlike enterprise --</l>
<l rend="indent">Like some great gull on high</l>
<l>Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then do I feel with God quite, quite alone,</l>
<l>High in the virgin morn, so white and still,</l>
<l rend="indent">And free from human ill:</l>
<l>My prayers transcend my feeble earth-bound plaints --</l>
<l>As though I sang among the happy Saints</l>
<l rend="indent">With many a holy thrill --</l>
<l>As though the glowing sun were God's bright Throne.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My flight is done. I cross the line of foam</l>
<l>That breaks around a town of grey and red,</l>
<l rend="indent">Whose streets and squares lie dead</l>
<l>Beneath the silent dawn -- then am I proud</l>
<l>That England's peace to guard I am allowed;</l>
<l rend="indent">Then bow my humble head,</l>
<l>In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">SHADOWLESS lies the land</l>
<l>Under the sun,</l>
<l>Only the poplars stand</l>
<l>With moveless boughs in the heat</l>
<l>That broods o'er the blackened wheat</l>
<l>And the ground so hardly won.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>No other tree in the waste.</l>
<l>They only stand</l>
<l>Where the straight white road is traced</l>
<l>Athwart the land.</l>
<l>And ever under the sky</l>
<l>Do the slow-winged birds go by --</l>
<l>The slow black birds of prey</l>
<l>That wait but the close of day</l>
<l>For the night to bring them food.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The curse of the heat is here,</l>
<l>And the curse of blood.</l>
<l>Cold-lipped, and with eyes of fear,</l>
<l>'Neath the sun's flood</l>
<pb n="22"/>
<l>Wanders the spirit of death;</l>
<l>And e'en in the burning noon is an icy breath</l>
<l>And the red of the west is to me like the redness of blood.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The village is still as the heat,</l>
<l>From the ruined houses start</l>
<l>The rats across the street. --</l>
<l>There is never another sound,</l>
<l>For the guns are silent to-day,</l>
<l>And the endless lines of men that are bound</l>
<l>For the place of death and the nameless mound</l>
<l>Have taken another way.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>At the end of the ruined street</l>
<l>Roodless the church yet stands</l>
<l>To the God men praise with their lips</l>
<l>While they mock Him with their hands;</l>
<l>With hands that have scrawled for sport</l>
<l>Their jests on the altar-stone,</l>
<l>And their ribald words on the lips of Christ,</l>
<l>The marred Christ hanging alone.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Who has measured pain,</l>
<l>And who has a plumb for that sea</l>
<l>Where the soul shall know again</l>
<l>Its own immensity?</l>
<pb n="23"/>
<l>For the voice of the mind is dumb,</l>
<l>But the voice of the soul is heard,</l>
<l>Where the wild dark waters are come</l>
<l>And the face of man's sky is blurred.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Who shall say "Lo here</l>
<l>Shall the glory of war be found,</l>
<l>That a nation arose without fear</l>
<l>And smote her foe to the ground</l>
<l>For the wrong that he dared to dream,</l>
<l>And the hell that he wrought on earth;</l>
<l>That she pressed after Honour's gleam</l>
<l>Though it led to a land of dearth"?</l></lg>

<l>And who shall assign it a bond?</l>
<l>Where the scornful might of the strong</l>

<l>Ah! myriad wrongs spring up</l>
<l>Where one has set its feet,</l>
<l>And the earth is a poisoned cup</l>
<l>Where the goodly wine brings death,</l>

<l>What of the god-like men</l>

<lg>
<l>A thousand ages ago</l>
<l>Man fought with the axe of stone</l>
<l>That the many might seize the thing they loved</l>
<l>From the few, and hold it alone.</l>
<l>For the will of the strong was law</l>
<l>And the right of the weak was death</l>
<l>When man was one with the beasts of the earth</l>
<l>And battled with them for breath.</l></lg>

<pb n="25"/>
<lg>
<l>And to-day with their coward lips</l>
<l>Men prate of love in their creeds,</l>
<l>And a thousand times today</l>
<l>Do they spurn her with their deeds.</l>
<l>For we talk of the law of truth</l>
<l>While our God is the law of might,</l>
<l>And the will of the strongest there</l>
<l>Is the thing we hold as right.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What have we gained with the years,</l>
<l>But the greater power to lie?</l>
<l>We, who speak of the truth,</l>
<l>Smooth-voiced and with side-long eye;</l>
<l>Better the axe of stone</l>
<l>And the feet on the weakest throat</l>
<l>Than the lying lips and the coward thrust</l>
<l>And the stealthy eyes that gloat.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now for the one's desire</l>
<l>Shall the many be crucified</l>
<l>On the cross of a lawless power</l>
<l>With the nails of a soulless pride.</l>
<l>And the wrong goes deeper yet,</l>
<l>Aye, deep as the springs of life,</l>
<l>And has blossomed out at the 'hest of pride</l>
<l>In the deadly flower of strife.</l></lg>

<pb n="26"/>
<lg>
<l>And nothing shall purge the land</l>
<l>Where the curse of sin has stood</l>
<l>But the purge of the whetted steel</l>
<l>And the drench of blood.</l>
<l>While perchance at the end shall Peace</l>
<l>Her impotent pinions spread</l>
<l>O'er the ruined home and the smoking land</l>
<l>And the blank eyes of our dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Hark! -- through the lazy air</l>
<l>Comes the sound of guns again.</l>
<l>Once more man reaps with a sickle of fire</l>

<l>Of some forgotten glory. By the way,</l>
<l>Outlined in black against the sky, there stands</l>
<l>A wayside crucifix among the corn;</l>
<l>Waiting with tired eyes and outstretched hands</l>
<l>In patient expectation of the morn.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The gentle whisper of the poplar trees</l>
<l>Is hardly loud enough to break the spell</l>
<l>Of mystic silence. From the church tower's height</l>
<l>Comes, wafted onward by the dying breeze,</l>
<l>The solemn tolling of a single bell;</l>
<l>Then silence and the mystery of night.</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">Of summer dawn, and summer noon and night,</l>
<l>The dewy grass, the dew-wet fairy rings,</l>
<l rend="indent8">The lark's long golden flight.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Deep in the forest I made melody</l>
<l rend="indent">While squirrels cracked their hazel nuts on high,</l>
<l>Or I would cross the wet sand to the sea</l>
<l rend="indent8">And sing to sea and sky.</l></lg>

<pb n="40"/>
<lg>
<l>When came the silvered silence of the night</l>
<l rend="indent">I stole to casements over scented lawns,</l>
<l>And softly sang of love and love's delight</l>
<l rend="indent8">To mute white marble fauns.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Oft in the tavern parlour I would sing</l>
<l rend="indent">Of morning sun upon the mountain vine,</l>
<l>And, calling for a chorus, sweep the string</l>
<l rend="indent8">In praise of good red wine.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I played with all the toys the gods provide,</l>
<l rend="indent">I sang my songs and made glad holiday.</l>
<l>Now I have cast my broken toys aside</l>
<l rend="indent8">And flung my lute away.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>A singer once, I now am fain to weep.</l>
<l rend="indent">Within my soul I feel strange music swell,</l>
<l>Vast chants of tragedy too deep -- too deep</l>
<l rend="indent8">For my poor lips to tell.</l></lg>

<l n="1">A WOODEN cross above your head,</l>
<l>You lie, your course already sped;</l>
<l rend="indent">And in this alien plain must rest</l>
<l>The bones and body Cotswold bred.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Not long since, insolent with life</l>
<l>You made the beech-topped barrow rife</l>
<l rend="indent">With your tumultuous vivid youth,</l>
<l>With other lads, in sport and strife.</l></lg>

<pb n="60"/>
<lg>
<l>And though you shook the earth o'er those</l>

<l rend="indent">Your careless clamour had no power</l>
<l>To trouble their sublime repose:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Who, if they felt at all the tread</l>
<l>Of such as you pass overhead,</l>
<l rend="indent">Wise with the wisdom of long years</l>
<l>Were patient, knowing that their bed</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Was spacious, patient too, withal;</l>
<l>That centuries after you were thrall</l>
<l rend="indent">To undistinguished dust, they still</l>
<l>Would hold their place, each in his stall.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But now, ere many months are told</l>
<l>Over <hi rend="italic">your</hi> head, encased in mould,</l>
<l rend="indent">Children may play, with little care</l>
<l>Of one beneath them, silent, cold.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Take my salute: ere twenty years</l>
<l>You knew, you reckon as your peers</l>
<l rend="indent">The men of axe and spear of stone,</l>
<l>As far removed as they from fears</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And doubts that vex men such as me.</l>
<l>From all demands from henceforth free</l>
<l rend="indent">On weary limbs and spirit tired,</l>

<l n="1">A LONG low line of polished white</l>
<l>Faintly the cliffs of England gleam,</l>

<l>Strange joys, strange sorrows to impart,</l>

<l>A quiet wood, a quiet lane,</l>
<l>The song of birds amid the trees,</l>
<l>The splash of sun, the sting of rain,</l>
<l>The warm sweet air, the sighing breeze,</l>
<l>And you beside our cottage door</l>
<l>At eventide. Dear heart, once more</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I see the first faint sunbeam tip</l>
<l>The East with gold, the hills light up,</l>
<l>Or stealing lower softly sip</l>
<l>The dewdrop from the rose's cup;</l>
<l>The glint of gorse upon the down,</l>
<l>The long ploughed meadow strong and brown.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>We wander 'mid the grassfield where</l>
<l>The busy reaper wends his way,</l>
<l>The sharp scythe flashes on the air,</l>
<l>Heavy the scent of new-mown hay</l>
<l>Floats down the breeze, and all around</l>
<l>The stricken poppies strew the ground.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Slowly my half-felt sorrows go</l>
<l>And hope comes, gazing seaward where</l>
<l>The dim cliffs glitter, for I know</l>
<l>That these and you await me there,</l>
<l>And I shall find them dearer far</l>
<l>Enriched by all the pangs of war.</l></lg>

<l>"Ah, hush!" he breathes, and gazes at the door,</l>
<l>That creaks on rusty hinge, in pale affright!</l>

<l>A pause -- I hear the trees sway sighing thro'</l>
<l>The gloom, like dismal moan of hollow knell,</l>
<l>Then out across the dark, and startling me</l>
<l>Bursts forth a laugh, a shout of drunken glee!</l></lg>

<note id="moresongs0n1" place="foot">
Flight Sub-Lieut. Frank C. Lewis, R.N.A.S., was killed in aerial combat in France on August 21st, 1917, aged 19 years. He had only been twelve days in France, being selected for a fighting squadron three days after he landed. His squadron commander described him as having already proved "a brilliant pilot," and of his last air fight that "he fought bravely to a noble end." He fell in our lines and is buried at Bailleul. The Belgium sonnets were written in 1915 while he was a boy at Marlborough.</note>

<l>Of many an army passing by</l>
<l>Under a blue and cloud-flecked sky.</l>
<l>And happy they who fell in fight</l>

<l>You are not as this other land</l>
<l>Trodden by all who chance to pass:</l>

<l>Who love to feel the beat of rain</l>
<l>Washing away all town-born pain:</l>
