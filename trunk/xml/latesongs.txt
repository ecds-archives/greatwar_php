THE DREAMS

WHEN I am sleeping I go in dreams

Far from the children and the man beside,

I meet with the dead and talk, nor strange it seems,

Since I've forgotten that they ever died.

They come in so quietly, the loved and lost.

There is so much to say in a short while.

Nowise strange it is that a dear ghost

Should be as the living and be glad and smile.

In the old garden we go hand in hand.

When friends are long parted there is much to say,

Much to be explaining and to understand.

We walk in old gardens in a long-dead May.

Breasting the hill we go we skirt the wheat,

By houses and gardens that once I knew.

All too fast the time goes when old friends meet.

Sure, I was starved for you, and you, and you
Was I forgetting, then, the patient dead I

Mercy of mercies that in dreams they live!

They come seeking and finding me upon my bed.

In dreams they comfort me, in dreams forgive.

They come to me in my dreams, not cold and lone.

Oh, never sad ghosts they come to fret my sleep,

But just as I knew them in the days long gone.

When I wake from my ns I wake to weep.

AFTER YEARS

I GIVE God glory and grace

I am come home again

To the delightsome ways

And the wild soft rain.

Lights on the hill and plain

As in remembered days.

Now I am home again,

I give great praise.

When I awake at dawn,

I hear the birdies sing;

Deep dews in field and lawn,

The mountains in a ring;

Life an enchanted thing,

The hour grey as a fawn;

I whisper thanksgiving

When I awake at dawn.

I seek no more the town,

Ah, wherefore should I gu

Hills to the sea look down,

The rivers softly flow.
With friends of long ago

Life has a golden crown,

In fields I used to know,

And meadows grey and brown.

And if the night be chill,

Of fuel I have great store;

We heap the fire until

The faggots leap and roar.

All my beloveds of yore

Of talk shall take their fill

Till the grey dawn's at the door

And the grey wind at the sill.

THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN

THE Little Old Woman has found you at last,

The Little Old Woman who is born a Queen;

She stands and she rattles at the door long-fast:

Gladly it opes to her, and she steps in.

The Little Old Woman is the World's Rose.

With the milk and the honey she comes again.

Were you forgetting her for These or Those

The Little Old Woman has the hearts of men.

Under her tatters she is fair and young:

Sweetness of sweetness is her honey mouth;

Men have died for her to save her wrong;

Love been spilt for her through the long drc

Were you forgetting her for These or Those?

Shall you forget her to the last heart-beat

Dark Rose of Tenderness, and the One Rose

To turn Life bitter and to make Death sw:
SANCTUARIES

THOU givest me greenest sanctuaries 
As the birds have the trees. 
The birds have the trees and I 
Deep shadow and blue sky, 
A well of waters, a palm tree, 
A bird and a bee.

As though I were Thine only one 
Thou makest for me alone 
A hearth-fire in the wintry cold, 
A walled city, a sweet fold, 
A winged sentinel to tell 
To the night: All's well!

Thou spreadest over me and mine 
The night a-shine 
With strange and wonderful eyes of stars; 
And weary of the day's wars 
Into the nest of love we creep 
And lie asleep.

Hearts are Thy sanctuaries: Thou hast set 
Wide open a heart's gate 
Where I come in and am at rest, 
A bed for my heart, a nest, 
Sure comfort, surplusage of love. 
Thou givest enough!

Woods are Thy sanctuaries and all 
Dear gardens musical, 
And fields and groves where it may be 
Thine angel walks with me. 
Thine angel! Nay, but Thou dost walk 
With me and talk.
AN ABIDING CITY

My city walls are builded sure Whatever foes assail;

I go my ways in peace secure As I were clad in mail.

The Hand that holds me keeps me well, 'Twixt earth and heaven I rest.

Within that Hand in joy I dwell, Without am sore distrest.

Free from all cares this Hand doth hold Poor folk that creep within.

Darkness and grief are turned to gold, There's naught of soil or sin.

When dawn comes redly up like wine It shines through Fingers five;

The Precious Blood was shed long-syne To keep my soul alive.

Safe in that Hand nothing I dread, No foe shall make me fear.

I who have roses for my bed Soft as a bosom dear.

My city walls are builded strong, My sentries go in white,

The years long and the seasons long Pass in a dream of light.
ANNIVERSARY

THERE were so many to pray for, 0 dear grey head,

Your day went out unnoted; but when I slept,

Tender and all-forgiving you came from the dead,

Came in my dreams to remind me of trysts unkept.

Never a prayer was offered: no Mass was sung:

I thought day-long on the stranger in bitter need.

Into my dreams, my dear one, as when I was young,

You came and we clung together, 0 dear grey head.

All night long it was parting, and parting soon

All night long I was weeping, and weeping sore

That was the loneliest parting under the moon,

When the day and the night together met at the door.

Dear, but you had to travel so far to remind

Your daughter who went forgetting, ah, cold as the clay!

All night long you stayed with me, fond and kind;

All night long you grieved with me until the day.

THE LAST QUARREL

As I lay sleeping on my bed,

Before the dawn of day, I dreamt my only Love was dead

My only Love aiway.

Oh, dreadful anguish of a dream,

Beyond all waking grief!

In all the darkness not a gleam,

Nor in the pang relief.

Yet was I spared the sharpest sword,

And the fierce thrust thereofI had forgotten the last word

Wherewith I sped my Love.
THE TREE

THINK of her when she shall be dead

As of a kindly tree

Within whose boughs some nests were made

For downy babes to be.

Through sun and shade on the greensward

Her songs went up in praise

Who mused upon the forest's Lord

Through all her length of days.

No king of woodland she, but just

A small tree, low and wide,

By which some faint from heat and dust

Sat down well satisfied.

Say that she had a well to keep

Where all might drink their fill,

Say that she comforted with sleep

The sorefoot traveller still.

Say that the creatures came to graze, 

And lay in pastures cool

Beside the pleasant water-ways, 

And her content was full.

Say that her pleasant maze of shade 

Soothed the aching eyes

Like dew upon the heavy head 

Under the throbbing skies.

Say that her birds were never far 

But they came home again

And in her branches singing were 

Despite the snow and rain.

Say that in Spring her boughs were green, T

he joy ran in her blood,

That Summer clad her like a Queen 

Under a velvet hood.

But say that when her Autumn came 

Her best was yet to be:

She clad herself in gold and flame 

Like to a Burning Tree.
Say that she feared no Winter white 

In whose thin boughs did swing

The moon, the stars, for a lantern bright 

To light the feet of Spring.

Say that her head was never bowed 

Though trouble might befall,

The bird in her heart sang low and loud 

And made amends for all.

Say that in fine, her spring beside 
She was merry and gave grace.

And some were sorry when she died 

Who lost a resting place.
THE STORY OF THE BAMBINO

WHAT is it like a light that goes 
Swaddled in gold from head to toes

With chanting cleric and acolyte 
In the crimson and in the white.

'Tis the Bambino goeth with speed 
To succour a woman in her need,

For the dear Lady's sake who lay 
And bore her Son in the cattle's hay.

The woman is taken in mortal strait. 
Peace! the Bambino is at the gate!

The woman cries from her loneliness. 
Peace! the Bambino cometh to bless!

Three fair sons she hath borne in pain: 
The three lie out in the night and rain.
Dear Bambino, dear holy one, 
Save for this mother one little son!

To her own heart she speaks: If he, 
The blest Bambino, would stay with me,

Surely my pangs would be light and short, 
Nor the little bird new-'scaped take hurt.

Joy and peace would be mine and his 
Who comes when the travail hardest is.

Surely my little son would thrive Nor go to his brothers who would not live.

Under the linen sheet there is 
Another Bambino like to this;

Painted so fine, carven so well, 
No man could one from the other tell.

The dear Bambino by her is laid, 
Joy is come to the childing-bed.

She takes from Bambino his robe and crown; 
The false Bambino hath a gold gown.

On the Bambino she turns the key: 
I and my babe shall have joy: saith she.

Her travail is over ; the child is come 
No finer baby may be in Rome.

The women cry from their beds and pray: 
Blessed Bambino, where dost thou stay

The priests come singing their hymns and bear 
The false Bambino high in the air.

The people drop on their knees and cry 
Viva Bambino / while that goes by.

Bambino goeth in gold and white; 
No woman is eased of her grief to-night.

For the true Bambino lieth forlorn, 
Naked as Christ in the stable born.
Patience, Lordkin, the woman saith: 
Who has saved this night my son from death,

I will build Bambino so fair a shrine 
For Ara Cccli he will not pine.

He shall have a cradle as soft as down, 
And finest woollen to be his gown,

Not stiff with jewels, nor miniver, 
But soft for a precious baby dear.

The night is dark and the snows fall. 
What is it flits by the outer wall ?

There's a patter of naked feet, as soft 
As Mary kissed in the cattle-croft.

Whence is this baby in the chill light, 
Ringed about with a ring of light

The Burning Bush that Moses saw, 
And a golden bird in the golden shaw.

At Ara Cccli they sleep and dream. 
What is it flits in the wet moonbeam

The bell soundeth, the knocker too: 
Let me in: I have much to do.

Let me in, for I heard as I ran 
The women call me in street and lane.

The sleepy brother is come awake: 
Who is it knocketh before daybreak

A little child on the door doth knock. 
Oh, hear them crying, my piteous folk!

The door was opened and in there came 
A naked child in a golden flame.

The rain falls and the wind blows; 
In comes Bambino, fresh as a rose.

The women called me and I made haste. 
I, the Bambino, have travelled fast.
One hath taken my robe away: 
His feet are plaster, his body clay.

He hath no healing for them that cry 
On me in their bitter agony.

They have stripped the false usurper bare; 
They have taken the crown of gold from his hair.

They have cast him out, of his splendour shorn, 
He hath no care for the people's scorn.

Once more Bambino goes up and down 
The steep high streets of the groaning town,

And climbs the stairway, and through the door 
Brings life and healing as oft before.

The shrine in Ara Cdi hath 
Many new cradles, many a wreath.

MAGIC

A GOD, a god sits on my hearth, 
Laughs and plays with sober mirth, 
Sings a small song, merry and wild, 
As a bird might or a child.

As a kitten plays will play, 
Or a lamb on a May day. 
A happy, busy household elf 
Croons a wee song to himself.

Strayed here from some Olympian hill, 
This god in rose and daffodil, 
Yet boils my kettle, cooks my dish, 
Gives savour to the meats and fish.

I stretch my chilly hands above, 
And like my dog he fawns in love: 
Licks at me with a playful tongue 
And frisks, a bright thing, merry and ycun.
And yet so great a god is he, 
You shall approach him on your knee, 
Lest that his lightnings teach you awe, 
This Burning Bush that Moses saw.

He is the Ark no hand may touch, 
The Lily of Light without a smutch, 
The Living Rose that none may take, 
Caged in a gold and thorny brake.

This holy one stays with me still, 
Singing his small song merry and shrill, 
And hath so many things to do, 
There is no time to grieve or rue

For the great state he hath foregone, 
The Lord Sun's dear companion, 
Who toils and plays upon my hearth, 
Nor yet forgets his starry birth.

CALDRA

(On a Tyrone hillside)

THE little valley folded lies Amid the hills a-dream,

The silence, soft as lullabies,

Hushes the wind, the stream.

Here where no dreadful thing affrights, No lurking shadows creep,

Only the short sweet grass invites

The cropping kine and sheep,

The pagan giant takes his rest

Who died when this was new.

His huge slab broken o'er his breast

Has let the daisies through.

And round about and all around

The unchristened babies lie.

Only the mother knows the mound

And the name to call it by.
When the sad world is all in shade

They bring the babies here,

The little weary ones unstayed

By any Angel dear.

The mother lays her lamb away

Where soft South winds will blow

And where the sweet sun shines all day

On small graves in a row.

The mother smooths the clayey bed,

And sets the piteous stone

Where some most precious drowsy-head

Sleeps on alone, alone.

But when the Winter nights are long

And the hearth fires are bright

And babes sleep sweetly and grow strong

Lapped up in fleeces white,

And when the mother's arms let go

The happy babe full-fed,

These hapless ones in frost and snow

Must go uncomforted.

But the old giant in the mirk

He hears the cry and call:

Come hither, 0 children from the dark,

My arms have room for all.

No little babe need go afeard

Since he is strong and kind,

For all his armour and his beard,

His great voice on the wind.

The unchristened children rustle and stir,

Their hearts are not dismayed,

God sends as once St. Christopher

His pagan to their aid.

Now like a flock of frightened birds

The little ghosts will fly.

He hath mothered them with tender words

And stilled their lonely cry.

The pagan giant now grown mild,

His notched sword by his arm,

Draws close to him the hapless child

That never else was warm.
As a hen gathereth her brood 
He keeps from eve till morn 
The little orphaned ones of God
That died ere they were born.

THE RECOMPENSE

GOD made a Garden first for Man

Where He and Man might walk together,

Before the bitter days began

And when 'twas always perfect weather;

A Garden full of fruit and flowers,

The butterfly, the bee, the dew

Man had enough in those sweet bowers

Before the old snake wriggled through.

But when poor Man was driven away,

Hobbled and sad, from those bright portals,

When there was nothing more to say

Between the stript unhappy mortals;

When Eve went shivering in the wind,

With all her sweetness nipt by frost,

God put it into Adam's mind

To build a House; so all's not lost

'Twas built of clay and wattled boughs.

So comfortable 'twas, the creeping

Out of the rain into their House,

To dream of Eden in their sleeping.
He taught them next to capture Fire,

The wild sprite of the roaring storm,

And tether him to their desire

Upon a hearthstone bright and warm.

Yet there was something incomplete;

They wept for their remembered busses

Till God slipt something wondrous sweet

Betwixt His anger and their kisses

The Woman shall make Home: He said:

With children, and the hearth-fires burning,

And with her bosom for his bed

My Adam praise Me night and morning.

THE IMMORTAL

HERE, where I went in and out,

I no more may come and go. This with sweetbriar fringed about

Is another's garden, so His the master's foot to come In each dear, remembered room.

Such a blank, forgetting face

The house turns that was my house, Where I built a little space,

As the birds build in the boughs. But the birds-the birds are gone And the vernal days are done.

Forth I fare that once would stay.

I have neither walls nor roof, Being a traveller, blithe and gay,

In a world that's weather-proof, Where no rust eats in, no moth Frets the sacred altar-cloth.
Open, skies, and let me through.

Here I struck no roots to be Fearful of all winds that blew.

There I shall grow a tree, a tree 

Where in calm and shining weather, 

My birds and I shall be together.

THE HOUSE OF LIFE

THE life of the body's a cage, And the soul within it

Frets to escape, to be free,

Like a lark or a linnet.

But since the struggle's in vain,

She is weary ere long;

She chirps and she sings a little

To assuage her wrong.

Behind the bars she sits brooding Her evil mishap,

Like a wild little hare or a rabbit

That's caught in a trap,

Till, dazed with despair, she is weary,

And struggles no more,

But plays with the sun and leaf-shadow

That dance on the floor.

They call-they call to each other 0 sister so small,
Are you there ? Are you there, little brother, 

Behind the blank wall ?

Like a bird, or a hare, or a rabbit, 

Frightened, undone, 

The soul calls to another, be not alone.

SUMMER AIRS

THIS air's a lovely thing: it blows

Softer than any kisses are;

Touches my cheek like a wet rose

Drenched in all sweetness, near and far.

There's heather in it, miles on miles,

Rough sweetness of great seas that break

On Achill cliffs and Clew's dear isles;

Oh many a mountain, many a lake!

What soft invisible Loving clings

About my neck and lifts my hair

The Eternal Love in these wild wings

Meets me and clasps me everywhere.

Thou mad'st for me this air, this wind,

These heavenly sweets for me, for me

That I might live and thrive, 0 kind!

Fed on the very Breath of Thee.
THE NEWLY-BORN

THE little soul looked out

Into a world of pain,

And sore oppressed with fear and doubt,

Shut eyes again.

Heard not the mother's cries

Nor saw her arms stretched wide,

Slipped back again to Paradise

On the next tide.

So small, so soft, so fair,

And like a carrier-dove,

The little soul, Love's messenger,

Fled back to Love.

0, in this storm and din

What place for her abode

The little white soul but looked in

Flew back to God.
