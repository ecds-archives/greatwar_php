<l>The women are shouting for England and the men are drawing their swords.</l></lg>

<l rend="indent">Behold him stand, the Man Forsworn,</l>
<l>The warrior of the faithless word,</l>
<l rend="indent">The pledge disowned, the covenant torn,</l>
<l>Who prates of honour, truth, and trust,</l>
<l>Ere he profanes them in the dust.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When to yon fabric grey in fame,</l>
<l rend="indent">That Windsor lifts against the sky,</l>

<lg>
<l>France was a gallant foe and fair,</l>
<l rend="indent">That looked us proudly in the face,</l>
<l>With her frank eyes and freeborn air,</l>
<l rend="indent">And valour half-concealed in grace.</l>
<l>Noblest of all with whom we strove,</l>

<l>Here, where the Earth still nurtures men,</l>

<l rend="indent">Suffer ungalled his bit and spur.</l>
<l>'Tis with no heart of joy that we</l>
<l>Arise to smite them on the sea.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Glory we count of lesser worth</l>
<l rend="indent">Than wife and babe and hearth and home;</l>
<l>Theirs is the mandate speeding forth</l>
<l rend="indent">Our steps of thunder on the foam;</l>
<l>For them we fight, for them we stand,</l>
<l>Yea, and for faith 'twixt land and land.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>You that have linked your might with ours,</l>

<l>Your legions march in Truth arrayed,</l>
<l>And knightly Honour whets your blade.</l></lg>

<l>Where Volga to the Caspian pours,</l>
<l rend="indent">You have not poured in vain your sons.</l>
<l>From laughing lands of Rhone and Seine</l>
<l>You have not poured your sons in vain.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Let us a League of Man proclaim</l>

<l>As would be rightly held to shame</l>

<lg>
<l>At least on this unageing throne,</l>
<l rend="indent">That baffles the long siege of Time,</l>
<l>We have a monarch of our own</l>
<l rend="indent">To whom a crime is still a crime;</l>
<l>And pure in aim there sits afar</l>
<l>The patient, silent, storm-worn Czar.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="44"/>
<l>For one sole mortal it remained,</l>
<l rend="indent">One rash insulter of the Earth,</l>
<l>To teach the world wherein he reigned</l>
<l rend="indent">How much a Kaiser's word is worth.</l>
<l>A Kaiser's word, a Caitiff's vow!</l>
<l>Well have we learned their value now.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Over the bland and kindly Day,</l>
<l rend="indent">Unseasonable Night he flings;</l>
<l>Sinister darkness blear and grey,</l>
<l rend="indent">A horror of malignant wings.</l>
<l>Pain and red havoc he bestows</l>
<l>On them that only asked repose.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He is not hungrier for your lands</l>
