<l>DRAW into thine own being the circumambient Power,</l>
<l rend="indent">Till wholly invigorated by its divinity.</l>
<l>Thou art become enthusiast in every cell.</l>
<l>Poet throughout thy soul; breathing the fine</l>
<l>The starry breath of that spirit transcendent</l>
<l>Whose body thou may'st be, hast thou faith for it--</l>
<l>To vibrate, radio-active, with the intense</l>
<l>Joy of its immanent music, pain of the wild</l>
<l>Strange passionate intervals of its music.</l>
<l>That is no mere singing of words--pulsation</l>
<l>This, of celestial singing such as, it may be,</l>
<l>Thrills all the ether between the living stars,</l>

<p>Note. --The Fourth and Fifth Preludes and "A Non-Combatant" first appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Ploughshare</hi>, and "The Hill-top
Wood" in the <hi rend="italic">Poetry Review</hi>. "A Schoolmaster in Picardy" was
suggested by Albert Thierry's <hi rend="italic">Des Conditions de la Paix</hi> (Paris,
<hi rend="italic">L'Union pour la Veriti</hi>, 1916), partly written in the trenches.
Its author was killed at Aix Noulette, 26 May, 1915.</p>

FIVE PRELUDES</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<head rend="center">I</head>
<l>UP dripping from the sea</l>
<l rend="indent">Her weeds all watery,</l>
<l>She dashed against the windows as she came</l>
<l>The fringy hem of her wet</l>
<l>Cloak, and set</l>

<l>Me shivering closer to the genial flame.</l>
<l>Bleak was her face, turned westward from the</l>

<l rend="indent">grey</l>
<l>Uncompromising dawn of a grim day,</l>
<l>As though she would not countenance</l>
<l>Even his ungracious greeting!</l>
<l>O, when she turned her back on all romance</l>
<l>And left, so long ago, the East behind her,</l>
<l>Her heart of hope already had stopped beating.</l>
<l>Grey woman, going by my door.</l>
<l>There's nothing can remind her</l>
<l>Of colour any more!</l></lg>

<lg>

<head rend="center">II</head>

<l>O BUT a wood on a November day!--</l>
<l rend="left">Do you know the thing I say?</l>
<l>Do you see the russet bracken</l>
<l>That the sunlight lies among?--</l></lg>


<pb n="NOVEMBER"/>

<l>NOVEMBER</l>

<l>See the shafts of brass among the dreamy grey</l>
<l>Pillars, where the low sun strikes, flashing?</l>

<l>Above the cold still under-air</l>

<l>In the morning, pale above you,</l>

<l>Can you hear the north-wind passing</l>

<l>Over with his wingy flight?</l>

<l>Can you feel the quiet glee</l>

<l>Of the world's untroubled heart?—</l>

<l>Summer's dead, the bracken's dead:</l>
<l>In the earth the trees have buried</l>
<l>Safely with their sap their treasure:</l>
<l>All for wrestling, all for mirth.</l>
<l>They stand ready.</l>

<l>Do you see how glad and gay</l>
<l>Is the Earth with all her trees?</l>
<l>How they welcome in the season</l>
<l>Rude and gruff ?   How they give</l>
<l>Themselves to the November</l>
<l>Day, and to the rough</l>
<l>Hands of winter?—</l>

<l>They have humour to enjoy</l>
<l>The changing moods of time:</l>
<l>To smile with the cold light and say</l>
<l>"I take you, too, November!"</l>

<l>12</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>NOVEMBER</l>





<l>III</l>





<l>HOW lovelily the larches bear their dead</l>
<l>And the young oaks carry their widow-</l>
<l>weeds !</l>
<l>Gladder than Spring It is to see their glory</l>
<l>When the air Is cold above the snow.</l>

<l>I say it's a glad thing to see that tall young larch</l>
<l>Standing all maiden-stately in gold apparel</l>
<l>To welcome him who now shall strip her bare.</l>
<l>Or yon, her sister, lovelier In thinner gossamer,</l>
<l>As it were sunny gleaming dew-drops veiling</l>

<l>her:</l>
<l>And to know Winter laments naught but hath</l>

<l>his own pure splendour.</l>

<l>Winter!—when you stand here amid the wood.</l>

<l>There's some sublime gladness that summer</l>
<l>could not tell</l>

<l>Comes forth to praise you! Among these com¬</l>
<l>rades</l>

<l>I hear another mightier word of freedom</l>
<l>spoken.</l>

<l>They weep, but not corrosive tears.</l>
<l>They let grief go, it also frees them.</l>

<l>13</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>NOVEMBER</l>

<l>Stedfast, evading naught, from life they with¬</l>
<l>hold nothing.</l>
<l>Even their grief Is presently a toy</l>
<l>For the spirit of young laughter.</l>





<l>w</l>





<l>IV</l>

<l>HEN joy escapes me, It Is not this sin</l>
<l>or that I have committed, but, longing</l>
<l>after some unattalned delight, I have forgotten</l>
<l>my Divine Companion.</l>

<l>Numb to His touch, what can I know of joy?</l>
<l>It Is only In His presence that my spirit ventures</l>
<l>forth from Its shadowy lair:—only responding</l>
<l>to His touch my spirit ventures.</l>

<l>But I forget, and unaccountably my busy day</l>
<l>Is empty: meaningless seem the dear greetings</l>
<l>of my friends.</l>

<l>In His love Is my meaning: vainly I seek my</l>
<l>self elsewhere 1—I have outgrown my mind and</l>
<l>body. My spirit Is no more at home except</l>
<l>in His companionship.</l>

<l>There only, Is health for me, purpose and</l>
<l>happiness. But I forget: I recognise Him not:</l>
<l>I am no longer part of His delight, but my own</l>
<l>burden: my body and soul heavy with a forget¬</l>
<l>fulness that cuts me off from knowing Him at</l>

<l>hand: that, looking in His face, Is still alone,</l>
<l>and lying In His bosom, desolate.</l>

<l>14</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>NOVEMBER</l>





<l>IF we withheld thee not, O thou divine delight,</l>
<l>Thou radiance, whom we hide in our un-</l>
<l>happiness,</l>
<l>Our days would shine like gold thread in the</l>
<l>woof of night.</l>
<l>And God would take their labour for his</l>
<l>comely dress.</l>





<l>O thou divine delight, did we withhold thee</l>
<l>never</l>
<l>But dared with every breath to give thee</l>
<l>utterance,</l>
<l>Fear would have lost his foothold on the earth</l>
<l>for ever.</l>
<l>All of it caught again into the starry dance.</l>

<l>Aloof from thee, the oppressor holds himself, a</l>
<l>stranger;</l>
<l>The   unjust   shelters him   from   thee   with</l>
<l>shields of scorn:</l>
<l>MIghtest thou but rejoice in these, thou wouldst</l>
<l>endanger</l>
<l>The last withholding thrones that keep thee</l>
<l>yet unborn.</l>

<l>15</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>NOVEMBER</l>

<l>Thou art not childish glee, nor gladness only</l>
<l>art thou:</l>
<l>Thou art Creative Power whom we have dis¬</l>
<l>obeyed :</l>
<l>Thou art the pulse of God within us here and</l>
<l>now:</l>
<l>'Tis not of Death—of thee O life, we are</l>
<l>afraid.</l>

<l>Freedom's Fellowship</l>





<l>SEATED in the World's Playhouse, I beheld</l>
<l>The Great Piece playing. Often I rebelled</l>
<l>At watching, and was fain to disobey</l>
<l>The Voice that held me at that Passion Play</l>
<l>Of Man's Redemption, a spectator, far</l>
<l>Removed from the actual agonists of a war</l>
<l>Wherein myself was mixed.   Till onlooking,</l>
<l>There woke within me the aeonlan Thing</l>
<l>Displayed in all that action.   I was 'ware</l>
<l>Of Him whom I beheld: the Actor there</l>
<l>Across the footlights, the Protagonist.</l>
<l>As one who had looked upon a glass and wist</l>
<l>Not that it was a mirror, nor whom he saw—</l>
<l>So gazing, suddenly, I knew with awe</l>
<l>It was no stranger, nor that Piece of Strife</l>
<l>Another than the substance of my life. . . .</l>

<l>Often on that Playhouse I'ld turn my back</l>
<l>To wander In the woods of Goodly Stack</l>
<l>And squirrel-haunted Squerryes.    There,  the</l>

<l>trees</l>
<l>Showed me the sense of the ancient prophecies</l>
<l>That foretell a strange breaklng-forth of power</l>
<l>Beautiful as the unfolding of that flower</l>

<l>17</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Whose bud Is this mysterious Earth, that keeps</l>
<l>The glory so enfolded In her deeps</l>
<l>No man, however nimble be his wit,</l>
<l>Guessing at Its delight can image it.</l>





<l>II</l>

<l>AS a tall pine, grappling the rock below</l>
<l>To climb the unsubstantial air, will grow</l>
<l>On a hand's breadth of the hill-shoulder, so</l>
<l>On a mere span of space, therein set firm,</l>
<l>Shall rise that royal spirit that hath its term</l>
<l>In Godhood, will a man but give his whole</l>
<l>Passion and patience to become one sole</l>
<l>Substance for it, that he may stand sublime</l>
<l>Upon a shoulder of the Hill of Time</l>
<l>Witnessing to the Timeless;—may rise up</l>
<l>Erect, to dare the lightning with his top:</l>
<l>Wrestle with wanton tempests, and not break</l>
<l>In any of their capricious clutches: take</l>
<l>The sun's pitiless drouth, out of that fire</l>
<l>Fashioning fibres still to lift up higher</l>
<l>The challenging dark shadow of his crown.</l>
<l>Dizzily up he climbs, but he thrusts down</l>
<l>More than a pine Into the secret place</l>
<l>Forbidden to the light, beneath the face</l>
<l>Of Earth that looks on Heaven.   There Is the</l>
<l>fount</l>

<l>i8</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Of the ever-urgent impulse that doth mount</l>
<l>Up in the sap and out into the light,</l>
<l>Carrying the secret of that recondite</l>
<l>That enigmatic power, which is the mirth</l>
<l>Vibrant in all the Body of the Earth,</l>
<l>The gladness of Her being, whereof all</l>
<l>Things that are Hers partake. .</l>

<l>High in the tall</l>
<l>Pine's upper fork, the kestrel hath his seat;</l>
<l>While up and down its shaft with clattering feet</l>
<l>The nut-brown squirrel scrambles: screams the</l>

<l>jay:</l>
<l>The mild wood-pigeon all the livelong day</l>
<l>Flutes to his lady.   But the unexpressed</l>
<l>Residue of delight within the breast</l>
<l>Of Mother Earth aches so for utterance</l>
<l>In man as to becloud the pure expanse</l>
<l>Above him, burdening the atmosphere</l>
<l>Wherever he is gathered, with the sheer</l>
<l>Anguish of her unbearable delay</l>
<l>Till he respond to her, and She can say</l>
<l>That without which her joy is yet unspoken,</l>
<l>That   which   without   him   must   remain   but</l>

<l>broken</l>
<l>Fragments and enigmatic words. O when</l>
<l>That which already Is half awake In men</l>
<l>Bewildering their days with Impulses</l>
<l>Mysterious that they know not to appraise</l>

<l>19</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>And so seek to evade—when It shall gain</l>
<l>Them wholly, and they serve with might and</l>

<l>main</l>
<l>Its divine purpose to bestow on Man</l>
<l>God's meaning, they shall utter, for they can,</l>
<l>That Life on whose appearing Earth attends,</l>
<l>That word of words that changes into friends</l>
<l>The foes that hear it, for before their birth</l>
<l>It cradled them within the heart of the Earth.</l>
<l>Then life's assembled hosts shall hear again</l>
<l>The fiat of creation, spoken plain</l>
<l>Among them all, and they shall understand.</l>
<l>Can you not feel the wonder close at hand!</l>
<l>The Earth is quick with it beneath my feet,</l>
<l>So nearly is the whole of life complete.</l>

<l>Ill</l>

<l>A ROOT was I, and burrowed down my</l>
<l>way</l>
<l>Year after year through sorry coloured clay;</l>
<l>And it was liker death than life to me</l>
<l>Through all that miry age of misery.</l>
<l>My spirit with enduring patience bore</l>
<l>By some mere pebble to be thwarted, or</l>
<l>To be encouraged by the slimy ooze</l>
<l>To new blind patient toil: my spirit whose</l>
<l>Manhood was made expressly for the wide</l>
<l>Regions of the light, where it would open-eyed</l>

<l>20</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Enter some little into God's design,</l>
<l>Echo his windy words, and even divine</l>
<l>The informing joy, clear, lucid, beautiful,</l>
<l>That lurks within all substance as a soul.</l>

<l>I strove, I sulked, I struggled for my breath</l>
<l>In that dark under-life that was like death,</l>
<l>So strange to any enfranchisement it seemed.</l>
<l>And I grew strong in the dark and stubborn-</l>
<l>limbed</l>
<l>In that unkindness: yet withal I knew</l>
<l>My stubborn strength was of itself untrue</l>
<l>To   something   in   me,   though   it   was   fuU-</l>

<l>vigoured:</l>
<l>For, nourished on resistance and the niggard</l>
<l>Diet of strife, I could not tell the whole</l>
<l>Truth that was kept a secret in my soul.</l>

<l>Somewhere—^but far beyond hearing or see¬</l>
<l>ing—</l>
<l>Somewhere upon the utter brink of being,</l>
<l>There dwelt another me, in other fashion</l>
<l>Occupied, fed upon a generous ration</l>
<l>Of open light and free air.   I had seen</l>
<l>The immortals, in a world of gold and green</l>
<l>And azure, that is only just beyond</l>
<l>The surface of the earth, free of its bond,</l>
<l>And floating all, as though upon a sea,</l>

<l>21</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Buoyed up on their aerial liberty.</l>

<l>But stranger than to know them anchored there</l>

<l>Almost within my reach—should I but dare</l>

<l>Reach up a moment from my groping toil,</l>

<l>Lift myself but a little from the soil</l>

<l>Into the sun—a voice familiar bade</l>

<l>My heart leave off its striving and be glad</l>

<l>In the translucent blessedness above me:</l>

<l>For these bright presences were they that love</l>

<l>me,</l>
<l>And I their kin, companion and compeer.</l>
<l>Inhabitant already of their sphere</l>
<l>Of iridescent light, was I, unknowing:</l>
<l>Groping below, my spirit had been growing</l>
<l>Upward into a leafy-headed tree</l>
<l>That floated even now upon that sea</l>
<l>Of windy light, and was companion with</l>
<l>Those earth-born joys that breathe immortal</l>

<l>breath.</l>

<l>I lifted up my heart: I was hft up</l>
<l>So upon gladness that I could not stop</l>
<l>Uttering twiggy praises full of leaf</l>
<l>Into that wondrous light as though all grief</l>
<l>Of my long labour in the dark were over</l>
<l>And I had now no more to do but hover</l>
<l>Upon the air, crooning my happiness</l>
<l>Fond as a pigeon.   Now the pitiless</l>

<l>22</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Lonely urge of my blind will down and down</l>
<l>Pulsed up out of my trunk into a crown</l>
<l>Of heavenly leaves: my stubbornness became</l>
<l>Gentle with gladness: I shook off the shame</l>
<l>Of my frustrated will, frustrated now</l>
<l>No longer, but achieved in every bough.</l>

<l>Now I have franchise both of sun and earth,</l>
<l>Till my last root is merry with the mirth</l>
<l>Of March, and I outstretch my branches bold</l>
<l>To joy, in the stubborn strength of that root-</l>
<l>hold.</l>
<l>I live in the earth: I am no flickering wraith</l>
<l>Of fancy but the embodiment of faith.</l>

<l>IV</l>

<l>THERE are great spirits that stand up</l>
<l>alone</l>
<l>As here and there an oak stands in a zone</l>
<l>Of corn and ample meadows: hero trees</l>
<l>Staunch in themselves against all enemies</l>
<l>And royal to small creatures in bad weather:</l>
<l>And there are spirits as great that stand to¬</l>
<l>gether</l>
<l>In an Inseparable fellowship.</l>
<l>Like the high pines on a hill-slope that's deep</l>
<l>In their long-fallen needles: spirits that are</l>
<l>As the high pines erect and columnar,</l>

<l>23</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Because for many a lustre diey have stood</l>

<l>Rank upon rank together in the wood,</l>

<l>Until each one is not so much a tree</l>

<l>As member of that great society</l>

<l>Of friends in whose association dwells</l>

<l>A presence I discover nowhere else.</l>

<l>And I have known a Quaker meeting when</l>
<l>The strangely still, intensely real men</l>
<l>And women ranked about me in the deep</l>
<l>Silence, were like a group of trees that keep</l>
<l>In their mysterious circle the untold</l>
<l>First and last secret of the manifold</l>
<l>Wonder of the world: a group of druld trees</l>
<l>Still haunted by the primal mysteries,</l>
<l>The elemental presences that are</l>
<l>Ever about us unfamiliar.</l>

<l>I was in a great grove of mighty thewed</l>
<l>Storm-challengers, that make a solitude</l>
<l>By their august companionship.  Apart</l>
<l>Spaciously set with magisterial art</l>
<l>To entertain In mutuality</l>
<l>Those vast emotions that could never be</l>
<l>The guests, even of comrades, If they stood</l>
<l>Crowded together In a thicket wood.</l>

<l>I found a freedom In that company</l>
<l>Elsewhere I had not found.   For to be free</l>

<l>24</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>You must be rooted In the rock, and keep</l>
<l>Your proper distance for the swing and sweep</l>
<l>Of the impassioning rhythm to vibrate through</l>
<l>Your being and make music out of you,—</l>
<l>One clear note of that full spontaneous speech</l>
<l>That no man sings alone, but many, each</l>
<l>Exulting in a wonder wherelnto</l>
<l>Life pours the impetuous current of its blood</l>
<l>Pulsing from its one heart.  Upwells the flood</l>
<l>Of joy in them out of Its reservoir</l>
<l>Through every root that has gone groping far</l>
<l>Down through the soil to catch In the still deep</l>
<l>Bosom of the under-earth, that seems to sleep</l>
<l>Always, the secret thrilling of a life</l>
<l>Beyond the utmost reach of stormy strife,</l>
<l>Beyond exhaustion and beyond dispute.</l>
<l>Well may they stand splendid and resolute!</l>
<l>Out of the marrow of the world they draw</l>
<l>Their sustenance.   The everlasting Law</l>
<l>Vibrating like a voice through all earth's frame</l>
<l>Vibrates In each, and every one of them</l>
<l>Shares its authority.    Strangers to fear.</l>
<l>Most royally they give what Is most dear</l>
<l>To them.   Rooted in God and independent,</l>
<l>The ardour of their passion shines resplendent</l>
<l>As the moon's raiment when her beamy light</l>
<l>Clings round her dewily In the winter night.</l>

<l>25</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>





<l>WHO strays among them, let him have a</l>
<l>care</l>
<l>With what companionship he enters there:</l>
<l>For there are hours in which you cannot hide</l>
<l>Aught from the Trees: when you must open-</l>
<l>eyed</l>
<l>Behold the shapes of dream you carry about</l>
<l>The world with you—^your dark or shining rout</l>
<l>Of dreaded or desired Imagining.</l>
<l>To life about you leaps the Magic Ring</l>
<l>Your feet can never step out of, because</l>
<l>It Is your self that the dark circle draws</l>
<l>Enclosing you in the curve of its occult</l>
<l>Desire, against whose logic you revolt</l>
<l>With   half  your   will  in   vain.    Darkling,   it</l>

<l>sweeps</l>
<l>Its compass, and within securely keeps</l>
<l>You prisoner of the line invisible</l>
<l>Traced by the rebel half of your own will:</l>
<l>Invisible, till In this solitude</l>
<l>Of Great Trees It become strangely Indued</l>
<l>With substance,  and confront you with your</l>
<l>fate.</l>

<l>Ay, but the Wood Is not confederate</l>
<l>Against   you!—These   are   comrades   among</l>
<l>whom</l>

<l>26</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>The secret that is In your heart may come</l>

<l>Venturing forth out of Its secrecy</l>

<l>Into the worship that they make with me—</l>

<l>A spacious living silence underneath</l>

<l>A spread of branches Interwoven with</l>

<l>Slant sunbeams, in whose wide beneficence</l>

<l>Our spirits have no more need of defence:</l>

<l>A space of sunshine that dictates to none</l>

<l>The joy wherewith he shall be clothed upon,</l>

<l>But only bids him free his spirit wholly</l>

<l>Of chattering care and murderous melancholy.</l>

<l>And give It to delight: sunshine that quickens</l>

<l>That singing of the heart that flags and sickens</l>

<l>Where love's a prisoner and hath not yet</l>

<l>Climbed up on to the windy parapet</l>

<l>Of boundary cliff that gives upon the vast</l>

<l>Expanse of life, nor yet had heart to cast</l>

<l>Forth trusting to the waters of the sea</l>

<l>Of faith's incredible Immensity.</l>

<l>VI</l>

<l>I  AM myself at last, with now no more</l>
<l>Fluttering against the pane, at the locked</l>
<l>door</l>
<l>No more entreaty.    Now with bitterness</l>
<l>I claim no more forgiveness or redress:</l>
<l>The battle-cries that echo about me cease</l>
<l>To nerve me or unnerve me: I have peace.</l>

<l>27</l>

<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>My spirit from his age-long strife arose:</l>
<l>He stood no more contending with his foes:</l>
<l>Flung down his sword and shield: put off his</l>

<l>mask</l>
<l>Of warrior, and to his proper task</l>
<l>Turning with a quick gesture seemed no longer</l>
<l>The self I knew: wiser he was and younger.</l>

<l>I felt my body quicken with that might</l>
<l>Of mastery that is the soul's delight</l>
<l>When, from its secret chamber Issuing,</l>
<l>Clad in the candour of a May-morning,</l>
<l>Comes the Almighty Fiat forth that changes</l>
<l>The aspect of the world in all Its ranges</l>
<l>With a new rhythm, whereto all circumstance</l>
<l>Responds, and the eternal atoms dance.</l>
<l>Comes a new pattern, comes another norm</l>
<l>Into creation, and the subtle form</l>
<l>Of every creature answering to it, wins</l>
<l>Fresh meaning, and another age begins.</l>

<l>The peace I enter Into is alive</l>
<l>With living life, that needs no longer strive</l>
<l>Because It is triumphant as a flower</l>
<l>Whereof the air admits the sovereign power.</l>
<l>The substance of whose delicacy carries</l>
<l>Magic that with the power creative marries</l>
<l>So that Its ecstasy, and it alone,</l>

<l>28</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Brings to the earth a hitherto unknown</l>
<l>Henceforth eternally recurrent joy.</l>
<l>When I assign my heart to this employ</l>
<l>It lifts me up that suddenly I dare</l>
<l>Find foothold on the skyey thoroughfare</l>
<l>To journey on my errands.  Joy afresh</l>
<l>Sets her republic up within my flesh</l>
<l>With all its liberties of continence,</l>
<l>Where sullen moody disobedience</l>
<l>Answered the tyrant: for republican</l>
<l>Is the full-statured body of a man,</l>
<l>His freedom and delight are the good-health</l>
<l>Of that irradiated commonwealth</l>
<l>That Is so capable of joy its cells</l>
<l>Conspire together against whatever else</l>
<l>Usurps its government, but all their will</l>
<l>Is Gladness, his commandments to fulfil.</l>





<l>VII</l>

<l>O LARGE Is life!—The life I come Into</l>
<l>Stretches so large about me as I go</l>
<l>Upon my errands, that I seem to be</l>
<l>Already a dweller In that Liberty</l>
<l>That Is itself the immortal blessedness</l>
<l>I sought, but dared not deem I could possess.</l>
<l>I move about in it as in the temple</l>
<l>Built by my spirit for Its worship: ample</l>

<l>29</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>For it as the whole starry-raftered Night,</l>

<l>But not too lonely-wide for my delight</l>

<l>To fill it, as the worshipping fulfils</l>

<l>All some vast minster, when, crossing Its sills,</l>

<l>You enter from the noisy stranger street</l>

<l>And on the instant are a part of it:</l>

<l>So, when out of the trafllc I come in</l>

<l>To mine own freedom, once again I win</l>

<l>The great horizon of Reality—</l>

<l>To know In everything I hear and see</l>

<l>My fellowship, as it were all one life with me.</l>

<l>More than myself It is I: In It alone</l>

<l>I am the master of the fully-grown</l>

<l>Faculties of my spirit, incorporate</l>

<l>Only In Its high purpose to create</l>

<l>A body for my joy, a consciousness</l>

<l>That my delight shall hold against distress</l>

<l>If but for an hour: only in it I know</l>

<l>The Imperative command, that bade me go</l>

<l>Forth into birth and being, justified:</l>

<l>Only In it, Immortal, I abide</l>

<l>Set in my place, as in the firmament</l>

<l>Of godhood, till Its purpose be forspent.</l>

<l>For this my larger life is that wherein</l>
<l>I enter into Freedom, and begin</l>
<l>Participating in the power that flows</l>

<l>30</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Through all the living fellowship of those</l>
<l>That are Its members and embody it.</l>
<l>Though we be only simple folk that sit</l>
<l>Wrapped in its life together, one we are</l>
<l>With all the heavenly host that, star by star,</l>
<l>Declares God's Glory, filling up the span</l>
<l>Of worship, since the dark of death began,</l>
<l>With the inseparable company</l>
<l>Of them that enter into Liberty.</l>

<l>VIII</l>

<l>1AM among my comrades: my delight</l>
<l>Is all about me like a starry bright</l>
<l>Company.    All the wonder in the air</l>
<l>Is actual communion that I share</l>
<l>With that great fellowship in whom I am</l>
<l>Enkindled from a coal Into a flame.</l>

<l>Often when I am most alone that joy</l>
<l>Encircles me with friends: and they convoy</l>
<l>The ship of my desire safe through the shoal-</l>
<l>Waters into the open sea: my whole</l>
<l>Being is theirs because they set me free</l>
<l>Who catch me up into their company</l>
<l>And carry me out to the Open Sea.</l>

<l>When I am left with my defeated gladness,</l>
<l>And am beset about by sullen madness</l>
<l>That battens upon misery, and my numb</l>

<l>31</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Spirit cries out for succour—then they come</l>
<l>Thronging about me, and I feel the anguish</l>
<l>That ate Into my soul begin to languish</l>
<l>Because of them: I know again the strong</l>
<l>Arms of that joy whereunto I belong.</l>
<l>Anew each day with all my will I break</l>
<l>Out of the circle of these cares that make</l>
<l>A loneliness round the imprisoned heart.</l>
<l>For having once discovered myself part</l>
<l>Of the Great Life that only comrades know,</l>
<l>Something divine in me will not forgo</l>
<l>His birthright, but still challenges whatso</l>
<l>Arrogance of things seen would paralyse</l>
<l>The visionary power that makes me wise</l>
<l>To know my comrades of eternity</l>
<l>Sharing the moment of delight with me,</l>
<l>Respiring with me that Immortal breath</l>
<l>Fhat is one life beyond despair and death.</l>

<l>IX</l>

<l>FELLOWSHIP Is a  grove of trees that</l>
<l>stand</l>
<l>Taller than the thick wood on either hand</l>
<l>As heroes stand than men.    The heart lifts</l>

<l>higher</l>
<l>Entering here.   It ventures to aspire</l>
<l>To its full manhood: rises up above</l>

<l>32</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>Its puerility to imagine love</l>

<l>And friendship as the god-like exercise</l>

<l>Of all the soul.    It catches from the eyes</l>

<l>Of these companions glances that are strange</l>

<l>As sunbeams to the vulgar interchange</l>

<l>Of men and women: vaguely apprehends</l>

<l>As he enters here what Is this world of friends</l>

<l>So new, so wide, so full of worship.   Dread</l>

<l>Seizes him lest he let his thoughts instead</l>

<l>Of their clear thoughts Ignorantly deceive</l>

<l>His soul, and he begin to disbelieve</l>

<l>In their heroic truth, convinced again</l>

<l>Of the obsequious truths that seem so plain.—</l>

<l>It is not death but doubt that comes between</l>

<l>Spirits that for a golden hour have been</l>

<l>One spirit of delight.   Faith can make one</l>

<l>Of many, but In doubt's dominion</l>

<l>There Is no bond: love falls asunder: life</l>

<l>Is torn to pieces for the pack of strife</l>

<l>To feed on:   God Is argued into naught</l>

<l>By men who cannot hold the faithful thought</l>

<l>Of his transcendent purpose in the whole</l>

<l>World wonder. . . .</l>

<l>Entering, I bid my soul</l>
<l>Beseech in veriest humility</l>
<l>To become part of it like any tree</l>
<l>Of this great grove of aspiration planted</l>
<l>Together, by the breath of God enchanted.</l>

<l>33</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>I feel the grave humorous light caressing</l>
<l>The creatures of the wood: no dread oppressing</l>
<l>The stillness with solemnity to crush</l>
<l>Their mirthful life: but the half-audible hush</l>
<l>Is of some gracious God whose presence gives</l>
<l>A deeper meaning to each life that lives</l>
<l>In his presiding splendour, until each</l>
<l>Becomes a particle of the God's speech</l>
<l>To tell a truth It cannot comprehend,</l>
<l>Save that to that delight it loves to lend</l>
<l>Its heart.   Now he begins to utter me</l>
<l>Among them.   Now mine eyes begin to see</l>
<l>The meaning of the grove, begin to feel</l>
<l>The presence that these living forms reveal</l>
<l>In every gesture, every living line:</l>
<l>For now their comradeship Is become mine,</l>
<l>And this that, all together, they concealed</l>
<l>From me, eagerly now to me they yield.</l>

<l>There Is no onlooker may understand</l>
<l>The mystery embodied In that band</l>
<l>Of comrades.    Final truth it Is, and they</l>
<l>Only can know it.   He that would betray</l>
<l>The secret that is freedom must declare</l>
<l>The divine wonder in his being—bare,</l>
<l>Body and soul, In that translucent air:</l>
<l>Must become parcel of that infinite,</l>
<l>There is no other way to utter it.</l>

<l>34</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>FREEDOM'S FELLOWSHIP</l>

<l>O the world's meaning is a bud, a splendour</l>
<l>Sealed-up, saving as, to some spirit tender</l>
<l>To his caress, Love may vouchsafe a proof</l>
<l>Of what is yet hid.   She thenceforth aloof</l>
<l>A little from the press of men's affairs</l>
<l>Must stand.  Strangely, and all at unawares</l>
<l>The vision was vouchsafed: the unconcealed</l>
<l>Delight   of   earth.     Hers   now   the   perfect</l>

<l>wheeled</l>
<l>Glory of a hundred petals, still tight-packed</l>
<l>In Its November sheath.   O hers the Fact</l>
<l>That shall fulfil the world we sense and see</l>
<l>With its more intimate reality.</l>

<l>To Love</l>

<l>LOVE, to the little-loving nebulous Thou</l>

<l>Thy range</l>

<l>How beyond belief exquisite is Thy form!</l>

<l>Thou starry Light-bearer, young-eyed Child of</l>
<l>the Morning,</l>

<l>Impartest the purposeful meaning of the Crea¬</l>

<l>To the learners of Thee.—O Joy everlasting,</l>

<l>We that learn Thee are one joy, one composite</l>

<l>Are we Thy learners, together his fellow, the</l>

<l>Of Them that Beget Delight . . .</l>

<l>To beget a love-child who would not give the</l>

<l>But O, blessed are they that, loving, beget the</l>

<l>invisible</l>
<l>Form of Thy pure power, mighty deliverer,</l>

<l>Spirit of Sunshine!—</l>
<l>Apart from Thee, Love, Power is a monster.</l>

<l>Empty of value.</l>
<l>Vain all the wealth of nations, If it be not for</l>

<l>Thy spending:</l>
<l>Wasted the resolute toil of a people not learned</l>

<l>in Thee.—</l>
<l>Thine is fruition.   There is no joy but rejoiceth</l>

<l>In Thee.—</l>
<l>Love, lacking Thee, the ages miscarry.   Their</l>

<l>gathered-up knowledge</l>
<l>Is naught, for without Thee Truth is not.—</l>

<l>world.—</l>

<l>37</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>TO LOVE</l>

<l>The use of the world Is at last Thy joy that</l>
<l>abides:</l>

<l>Substance eternal, ether Irradiant with the com¬</l>
<l>plete</l>

<l>Purpose of an inexhaustible life outpoured.—</l>

<l>He who carries the wonder within him knows</l>
<l>it divine.—</l>

<l>Thou, Love, alone settest free.—I feel Thy</l>

<l>Patiently gather within me: Thy procreant</l>
<l>power grow</l>

<l>Sure in me of its sanctity: not-to-be-thwarted:</l>
<l>god-like:</l>

<l>All of me handling with calm clear eyes of de¬</l>
<l>cision :</l>

<l>Pouring my life forth with a Hand that is yet</l>
<l>my hand.—</l>

<l>Thou duly directest the crawling caterpillar,</l>
<l>Else a vain destroyer of delicate promises.</l>
<l>Eater of buds:—Thou transformest him into</l>

<l>an airy carrier</l>
<l>To and fro in the fields of the flowers' mes¬</l>
<l>sages.</l>
<l>It Is  only toward Thee  at last that  Desire</l>

<l>emerges</l>
<l>Out of Its chrysalis Into the light on wings.—</l>

<l>38</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>TO LOVE</l>

<l>Thou createst a whole out of this confusion of</l>
<l>parts,</l>

<l>In Thee the excesses of passion that are not</l>
<l>wholesome for life</l>

<l>Are justified: they come at last to their meas¬</l>
<l>ure in Thee.</l>

<l>Infinite Thy demand, O Love, as the infinite</l>
<l>blind</l>

<l>Urge of unuttered longing: wild, pent-up to</l>
<l>madness:</l>

<l>Fiery mouth not to be quenched at dear lips:</l>
<l>whose kisses</l>

<l>Poison Its love, till Thou, God, overpowering</l>

<l>That stormy power with Thy purpose, yoke it,</l>
<l>exuberant</l>

<l>To Thy task of creating Joy not less but more</l>
<l>passionate.—</l>

<l>Thou givest eyes to Desire.—^All my meaning¬</l>

<l>Thou makest whole that takest not less than all</l>

<l>that I can be.</l>
<l>That only Thou ownest for Thine wherein a</l>

<l>man pledges</l>
<l>Body and soul and spirit In one passion, holding</l>
<l>Earth for his witness and the eternal stars.—</l>

<pb n=""/>



<l>TO LOVE</l>

<l>When I began to love, and felt my soul going</l>

<l>forth</l>
<l>Away from me to the Unknown, I was afraid</l>

<l>to be squandered,—</l>
<l>So many a greedy mouth: many a snatching</l>

<l>hunger!—'</l>
<l>After, I feared lest this that was precious only</l>

<l>for spending.</l>
<l>Life's own seed, In me hoarded remain, and</l>

<l>perish.</l>
<l>Of Thee less ignorant now, I fear either death</l>

<l>no longer.</l>





<l>Immanent in our loving, Thou transcendest, O</l>

<l>Love, our passion:</l>
<l>All  of  our love  together  is but  a  little  of</l>

<l>Thee.—</l>
<l>Within Thine  orb,  as within the  all-circling</l>

<l>horizon,</l>
<l>Each of my passionate loves shines in his place,</l>

<l>secure:</l>
<l>Ever-sustainer of loveliness, world-enamouring</l>

<l>presence,</l>
<l>Loving them, I give worship, O not to them,</l>

<l>but to Thee.</l>
<l>Thou fulfillest, O Love, my entire manhood</l>

<l>TO LOVE</l>

<l>Thou art as the Sun. Thou beholdest the ugly</l>
<l>secrets of shame</l>

<l>Averting not thence Thy clear eyes: changing</l>
<l>not into hatred</l>

<l>Their undismayed regard.—Derelict, desert-de¬</l>
<l>feated.</l>

<l>The poor, pilgrim of life In his last extremity</l>

<l>Catches that wonderful gaze and on the instant</l>
<l>forgets</l>

<l>His dismay at the cries of the flocking heavy-</l>
<l>winged birds.</l>

<l>As with the triumphing choral of the great</l>
<l>Ninth Symphony</l>

<l>Joy breaks out of his torn body to Thy em¬</l>
<l>brace.—</l>

<l>Who now shall sustain the lad, the soldier de¬</l>
<l>scending.</l>

<l>Snatched like Kore the Maid from an April</l>
<l>world, down</l>

<l>Into the bowels of death. Into the underworld</l>
<l>air,</l>

<l>There to do battle, to make corpses with his</l>
<l>young hands—?</l>

<l>Only Thou art sufficient, down In that place, to</l>

<l>dower.</l>
<l>Be conjured, through some unbelief of mine</l>
<l>That doubts Thee or Thy coming, to assign</l>
<l>Itself to another lord, and so betray</l>
<l>My will to accomplish his desire:—delay</l>
<l>Thy coming to my government no longer,</l>
<l>So many a foe have I—^but Thou art stronger.</l>

<l>When I behold the promise of the world</l>
<l>Blighted, and all a kindly people hurled</l>
<l>In God's face with a lie by one mad will—</l>
<l>Love, I know hardly how to endure until</l>
<l>My little kingdom be possessed by Thee,</l>
<l>There comes so many a royal treachery</l>
<l>To impose upon my will—so many a claimant</l>
<l>To power, kingly and clad in shining raiment.</l>

<l>I am not unacquainted with Thee, Love,</l>
<l>But to know Thee a little is not enough.</l>
<l>Loving a little, must I not admit</l>
<l>These that look like Thee ?—^Whole and infinite</l>

<l>DELAY NOT, LOVE</l>

<l>All of my being may be in Thy possession.</l>

<l>The Greeting</l>

<l>HER pinched uncompromising face was</l>
<l>pitiful</l>

<l>Seeming to plead for love, and yet with what a</l>
<l>proud</l>

<l>Accent she said, setting my proffered love</l>
<l>aside:—</l>

<l>"My friend, if you had only looked with faith¬</l>
<l>ful eyes</l>

<l>Into the truth I showed you, if you had not</l>
<l>faltered</l>

<l>Upon the sills of sight and, guessing prema¬</l>
<l>turely.</l>

<l>So misconceived the look in which I told you all</l>

<l>As to make foolishness of it with your wild</l>
<l>answer,</l>

<l>You would have understood what I can never</l>
<l>tell:</l>

<l>You would have seen me, for I ventured forth</l>
<l>to you:</l>

<l>To you, unseeing, I came forth out of my</l>
<l>secret.</l>

<l>If haply, mirrored In your comprehending gaze,</l>

<l>I might at last behold my spirit unknown to me,</l>

<l>Know myself in your eyes, and solve at last my</l>
<l>riddle."</l>

<l>45</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE GREETING</l>

<l>I heard her speak, I made a silence of myself</l>
<l>That I might all be, as it were, one word of</l>

<l>welcome,</l>
<l>As it were hands held out all ready to receive</l>

<l>her—</l>
<l>Wherefore my lips were silent, hands folded</l>

<l>before me—</l>
<l>For her, all that I am was waiting in my eyes.</l>

<l>Then she came forth to me, radiant, a spirit</l>
<l>of light.</l>

<l>Before whose sovereign pure splendour the con¬</l>
<l>descension</l>

<l>My fond heart had prepared was utterly</l>
<l>ashamed:</l>

<l>I saw her: I forgot my folly, worshipping In</l>
<l>her</l>

<l>That wonder of else incredible divinity</l>

<l>That searches the world through if there be</l>
<l>any place</l>

<l>Unoccupied by the busy turmoil of our cares</l>

<l>Wherein Its quiet hands may find employment.</l>

<l>THE EXILE</l>

<l>He that most loves her, let him now be hard</l>
<l>Against her pitiful distress,</l>
<l>Lest it disarm his love of power to save her!</l>
<l>I dare not pity her howso by battle marred,</l>
<l>Howso sharp anguish cruelly engrave her</l>
<l>Dear old-time loveliness.</l>
<l>For I was bred of her and know</l>
<l>Her too self-pitying weakness:</l>
<l>How loving Liberty a little, to his foe</l>
<l>She yielded up herself with wicked meekness;</l>
<l>For when her love of him brought her to peril,</l>

<l>she</l>
<l>Failed in her little love and grew ashamed she</l>

<l>I wonder if Demeter's sunny-eyed</l>
<l>Daughter submitted so</l>
<l>Obsequiously, once she was Pluto's bride—'</l>
<l>Smiled so, being Queen in Hell</l>
<l>And mistress of her foe!</l>

<l>Did she—doth she so smile.</l>
<l>Hers Is a better right than yours,</l>
<l>Dreadfully mild mother of my exile!</l>
<l>For though, in chambers dark</l>
<l>Beyond Imagining, his love she endures,</l>
<l>Its nakedness Is not so stark</l>
<l>As your ^Egisthean lord's,</l>
<l>To whose tyrannous pleasure, rather</l>
<l>Than bid him do his worst.</l>
<l>Your too complaisant beauty accords</l>
<l>What erst</l>
<l>Was sacred to my father.</l>

<l>Freedom!—'Twas he begat me!   He whose</l>
<l>high begetting</l>
<l>Sings through my being that I am his son</l>
<l>Sprung of his blood and nation:</l>
<l>Sings with your young voice, Mother,</l>
<l>In the utterly sweet singing</l>
<l>Of that forgotten March when Germany</l>

<l>Music that still, in each and every one</l>

<l>Of all my nerves is mine beyond forgetting.</l>

<l>My spirit's exultation</l>

<l>He was my sire, none other!</l>

<l>I was young when he perished.   I remember</l>
<l>Those far days, and how then you delighted</l>
<l>In his babe.   It is my November</l>
<l>Now, and your joy in me long ago blighted.</l>
<l>But In me it is ever quick-water.</l>
<l>The bubbllng-up, throbbing</l>
<l>Of that long-ago joy,</l>

<l>That cradle-singing that before I was a boy</l>
<l>Was mine!</l>

<l>O, still a spring divine</l>
<l>Amid this world of slaughter,</l>
<l>It Is the heedless gay</l>
<l>Trill of some bold November robin</l>
<l>Whose small roundelay</l>
<l>Breaks down my grief and sets him sobbing.</l>

<l>Though I shall always carry about the mark</l>
<l>Of that grim boyhood in a world all dark</l>
<l>To me—Orestes-like, sun-worshipper am I.</l>
<l>But chiefly Thee I praise, O pitiless Apollo,</l>

<l>That me, O pitiless One, thou badest not</l>

<l>Striking at her with dreadful hands.</l>

<l>But, westering, bad'st me follow</l>

<l>Thee hither oversea,</l>

<l>To this, that of all lands</l>

<l>Was worthy of my father's name:</l>

<l>America, ample, republican and loyal</l>

<l>To Freedom her first love, and arbiter to be</l>

<l>Of Justice: pitiless, clear-eyed</l>

<l>As Thou, shadow-denier:</l>

<l>Thou, chaln-of-slumber breaker:</l>

<l>Thou, mocker at the tyrant and his bride:</l>

<l>Resolute world-awaker,</l>

<l>Muhlpller</l>

<l>Of rebels against vain authority!</l>

<l>This is thy land, Apollo, and at last like thee</l>

<l>The world's peace-maker.</l>

<l>Wonderful as to a fugitive slave</l>
<l>When he creeps trembling out of the hunted</l>

<l>wood</l>
<l>Into the welcoming security</l>
<l>Of a friendly hearth, her welcome was to me.</l>
<l>Slowly to It my numb being unfroze;</l>

<l>Cut sharply from its trunk, my twig</l>

<l>Flourished upon the free</l>

<l>Flowing, exuberant sap of that young tree</l>

<l>Of Liberty, whereon I was engrafted:</l>

<l>I made bold to declare</l>

<l>The secret manhood in me to that sun,</l>

<l>Responded to the greetings wafted</l>

<l>Me on that virginal air:</l>

<l>Freedom pulsed through me, faith in me grew</l>
<l>big,</l>

<l>Ousted my fear and took me all for Its do¬</l>
<l>minion.</l>

<l>With me there was transplanted</l>
<l>Into this generous  soil,  this orchard of my</l>

<l>choice.</l>
<l>So much of the old Germany</l>
<l>As It was granted</l>

<l>To a young lad to bear away with him.</l>
<l>Answering to the deeds of Liberty</l>
<l>There would thrill In the fibres of my being</l>
<l>Many an old clear voice</l>
<l>Of sunny Rhineland or of grim</l>

<l>And when in battle for her, I became</l>
<l>One body with America, and shed</l>
<l>Wholly mine orphanage of shame,</l>
<l>No more was I an exile hope-defeated,</l>
<l>Mine was this country of the exile's hope:</l>
<l>Even my father was no longer dead.</l>
<l>No longer was he of achievement cheated:</l>
<l>His spirit with mine exulted and found scope</l>
<l>For all Its courage in the storm</l>
<l>That burst upon America: I knew him</l>
<l>Then ever beside me, and before</l>
<l>Ever that Siegfried-murdering Attila,</l>
<l>Ever that sinister iEglsthean form</l>
<l>That pursues Freedom If he may</l>
<l>Seduce his bride from him once more:</l>

<l>Of my light bereft: defy</l>
<l>Loneliness, If only I</l>
<l>Could feel I had held nothing back</l>
<l>From Freedom In His hour of lack.</l>

<l>A NON-COMBATANT</l>

<l>Evermore I would rejoice</l>
<l>That I had recognised the Voice</l>
<l>Divine, and against any odds</l>
<l>Held to Him against the gods</l>
<l>And princes of this world.</l>
<l>Who have no stomach for the high</l>
<l>Mirth of His flag unfurled</l>
<l>Upon the sky.</l>





<l>When myself I utterly</l>

<l>Give to Freedom, I can be</l>

<l>The hateless weapon in His hand—</l>

<l>Let Him bid me, let me hear</l>

<l>The authentic voice within my ear</l>

<l>That I know for His command.</l>

<l>I have seen the eyes of Him</l>

<l>Who is Freedom: they are dim</l>

<l>With no doubting: naught of weakness</l>

<l>Dulls their gaze of piercing meekness;</l>

<l>It is brighter than the sun</l>

<l>That I cannot look upon.</l>

<l>I have felt His living breath</l>

<l>Challenge in me doubt and death:</l>

<l>Who am I that I should bear</l>

<l>Only to speak gentle and fair?</l>

<l>A NON-COMBATANT</l>

<l>I must be the battle-cry</l>

<l>Of Freedom, or become a lie</l>

<l>On His lips, when they would speak</l>

<l>Mortal Truth, though they be meek.</l>

<l>There Is not, nor ever shall</l>

<l>Be any peace on Earth till all</l>

<l>Life's great truth be spoken out:</l>

<l>Never while we fear to flout</l>

<l>Half-truth; while we dare not be</l>

<l>Hated of complacency:</l>

<l>Never till we give our whole</l>

<l>Being—^body, mind, and soul—</l>

<l>To Freedom, and stand forth among</l>

<l>Proud powers that put Him in the wrong.</l>

<l>MOONLESS,   republican, an April night</l>
<l>That   the   south-west  wind  burnishes</l>
<l>until</l>
<l>Thick-set, the stars blaze In It with the world's</l>
<l>Purposeful thought, which Zoroaster learned</l>
<l>And Abraham was wise in.   This, entrenched</l>
<l>In Picardy, he spells and understands.</l>

<l>Over him circle the Great Seven, sign</l>

<l>Of Labour and Promise.   Through a luminous</l>

<l>Of stars unspelled,  dips the Sun's pathway;</l>

<l>now</l>
<l>It leaves the Lion and the King behind</l>

<l>Justice, the Virgin, rules here: In her lap</l>
<l>Sits the world's hope: and shine In either hand</l>
<l>The Scales of Judgment and the Spear that is</l>
<l>A golden spear of corn, a Spike of Peace.</l>

<l>A peasant and a village schoolmaster.</l>
<l>Patiently he had tuned his little world</l>

<l>A SCHOOLMASTER IN PICARDY</l>

<l>Was bygone folly afar-off that he heard</l>
<l>Smiling amid the garden of his school.</l>

<l>Far-off, till on that sudden First of August,</l>
<l>France calling him with her trumpets, his spirit</l>

<l>rang</l>
<l>Out like a trumpet answering hers.    Within</l>

<l>him</l>
<l>Sang a strange music that he heard amazed</l>
<l>And knew the old happiness was at an end.</l>
<l>He hated war, as though somewhere he had</l>

<l>been</l>
<l>A mother, matched a body with a soul</l>
<l>And made them one together magically,</l>
<l>To know the cost and meaning of a man.</l>
<l>Peace was dearer to him than to another.</l>
<l>Gave him her heart, and like a bride demanded</l>
<l>What most he longed to give her, that she</l>

<l>might</l>
<l>Transform his ardours Into life.   But War</l>
<l>Out of that happiness he was at home in.</l>
<l>Like a pre-destined passion snatched him away.</l>

<l>Transplanted In the miry field of death,</l>
<l>He and the stars night-long kept company.</l>
<l>Often of her he loved War minded him:</l>
<l>Different, yet with the same divine denial</l>
<l>Of the great dreamy idols men bow down to</l>

<l>She was a sister to his lady, Peace:</l>
<l>And when her masterful accompaniment</l>
<l>Challenged the singer in him with Its strange</l>
<l>Rhythms, his exulting spirit answering cried</l>
<l>New pasans against it in the praise of Peace.</l>

<l>Through all this visionary April night</l>
<l>He sees her face in memories.   At Leipzig,</l>
<l>He knows again how verily it was she</l>
<l>Fanning the passion that swept Bonaparte</l>
<l>Back over Rhine.   At Strasburg, it was she</l>
<l>Consenting not to a conquest that denied</l>
<l>The only meaning common to the world.</l>
<l>For as, when fond peace-makers Intervene</l>
<l>With "Recollect,  the man is now your hus¬</l>

<l>The  white-faced  woman,   answering nothing,</l>

<l>Silent, implacable, France In her heart.</l>
<l>Fed there upon such puissant love as nation</l>
<l>Knew   never,    France   became   Joan's   holy</l>

<l>The Plough driving Its furrow to the zenith</l>

<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>The Price of Freedom</l>

<l>A Footnote to Epipschydion</l>

<l>A large room at Pisa, 1820. Shelley, pacing</l>
<l>to and fro. Mary Shelley sewing. He</l>
<l>is twenty-eight, she is five years younger.</l>
<l>At this time Emilia Viviani was about</l>
<l>eighteen.</l>

<l>Shelley. My spirit, my real self, once It</l>
<l>was awakened into consciousness by your recog¬</l>
<l>nition, began to be aware of its need and of Its</l>
<l>power. I myself awoke to knowledge. All the</l>
<l>argument about Truth ceased because I was</l>
<l>face to face with Truth; or rather, the argu¬</l>
<l>ment was changed into a way of revelation, the</l>
<l>two parties completing for one another their</l>
<l>partial affirmations.</l>

<l>But the great change was In desire. Desire</l>
<l>is a seeklng-together of parts Into their unity.</l>
<l>But when once the nature of that unity has been</l>
<l>discovered, desire itself becomes different. For</l>
<l>the whole, which Is Love Himself, Is hencefor¬</l>
<l>ward awake within desire. It Is now no more</l>
<l>the blind longing of the creature after he knows</l>
<l>not what.   For now desire calls upon the God</l>

<l>105</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>within both me and the object of my longing,</l>
<l>so worshipping Him that He manifests Him¬</l>
<l>self, ruling, ordering. Illuminating, till the de¬</l>
<l>sire Is changed into delight of His presence.</l>

<l>Love Is no wantonness. It is the life of the</l>
<l>awakened spirit.</l>

<l>The rhythm of the divine life within me can¬</l>
<l>not but vibrate with that responding rhythm,</l>
<l>of which now and again it Is aware In some</l>
<l>kindred being. Thus vibrating together, we</l>
<l>are married Into one whole, as are the notes of</l>
<l>a music to which each note belongs.</l>

<l>This realisation of unity Is an extravagant</l>
<l>thing. It transcends the ordinary terms of</l>
<l>speech. It is beyond the measure of the senses.</l>
<l>When it seizes me, it seizes me with actual</l>
<l>rapture, so that I neither know myself or what</l>
<l>I am saying. It is the passion of a fuller In¬</l>
<l>carnation. Do you not see?—It is the Some¬</l>
<l>thing In which all that we have won together Is</l>
<l>enlarged and heightened into a fuller meanmg.</l>

<l>Mary {without looking up). So now it Is</l>
<l>this Italian!</l>

<l>Shelley.    Mary . . .</l>

<l>Mary.   Well! . . .</l>

<l>Shelley. You have frozen up my</l>
<l>words. .</l>

<l>Mary.   I want the truth.   I can bear that so</l>

<l>io6</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>much better than anything else. It's the not-</l>
<l>knowing what is true that I cannot bear. With</l>
<l>her you are happy. When you speak of her,</l>
<l>your whole face changes. But with me, see how</l>
<l>constrained you are! Why do you stay? I</l>
<l>will not keep you. For now, surely you know</l>
<l>it, our life together is a mere lie. I cannot go</l>
<l>on In It.   One of us must go away.</l>

<l>Shelley.   Harriet said that.</l>

<l>Mary.   Poor Harriet!</l>

<l>Shelley.   Poor Harriet!   Poor Mary!</l>

<l>Mary.   You dare to pity me! . . .</l>

<l>Shelley. Mary, do you remember when it</l>
<l>was that Harriet said what you were saying?</l>

<l>Mary.   Said what? . . . Yes, I remember.</l>

<l>Shelley. And how you said, "poor Har¬</l>
<l>riet, she's not herself"?</l>

<l>Mary. I did not understand Harriet then.</l>
<l>I was happy.   Now I understand.</l>

<l>Shelley. You mean, Mary, you feel as</l>
<l>Harriet did when she was not herself. So now</l>
<l>because you are not yourself, you cannot under¬</l>
<l>stand anything at all. You have become a mis¬</l>
<l>understanding of everything in order that you</l>
<l>may hold me back from what you do not un¬</l>
<l>derstand.</l>

<l>Mary. Do I want to hold you back? But</l>
<l>you—^you do not know what you are doing, or</l>

<l>107</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>where you are going, upon the current of this</l>
<l>river.</l>

<l>Shelley. So many times you have told me</l>
<l>truth, truth that I did not know till you had</l>
<l>told me; but this time it is not truth that you</l>
<l>are telling.</l>

<l>Mary. I am simply saying we must sepa¬</l>
<l>rate, since, however it be for you, for me this</l>
<l>life together is become a lie.</l>

<l>Shelley. No, but your going, my going,</l>
<l>that would be the lie.</l>

<l>Mary. Give me freedom, since you claim</l>
<l>it for yourself.</l>

<l>Shelley. Freedom is neither given nor</l>
<l>taken. It is the life of a spirit that Is true to</l>
<l>itself. Now, if you go, you are not true to your</l>
<l>utmost self.    If I go, I am but a traitor.</l>

<l>This I know about myself: I have all the</l>
<l>weaknesses and follies of which you ever justly</l>
<l>accused me:—(for you love and see me as I</l>

<l>to you continually for my judgment and my</l>
<l>strength.) But yet there is something in me—</l>
<l>it is you who have made me know It—there is</l>
<l>something that is at last the real Shelley: the</l>
<l>essential spirit—that neither passion nor any</l>
<l>kind of death can dissolve: something to which</l>
<l>I can and must entrust everything that I possess.</l>

<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>Do not make me doubt that, or you will de¬</l>
<l>stroy the Integrity of my soul which you dis¬</l>
<l>covered to me and have nourished. I shall</l>
<l>cease to be a man: I shall go back to the days</l>
<l>before ever I loved you: before you gave me</l>
<l>the pledge of my Immortal spirit.</l>

<l>Mary. When you loved me, then I under¬</l>
<l>stood.    But now</l>

<l>Shelley. What has befallen you, that you</l>
<l>say such a thing! As if ever now I could not</l>
<l>love you: as if ever now you could be less to me</l>
<l>—O God, how Infinitely more!</l>

<l>Mary. A woman Is either everything or</l>
<l>nothing to a man.</l>

<l>Shelley. That is the falsehood of love's</l>
<l>idolatry, which has nothing In common with our</l>
<l>truth and freedom. . If that is what you</l>
<l>mean by love . .! But It is you yourself who</l>
<l>deny It, Mary: there is nothing of that in you.</l>
<l>You freed me from that. That Is poor Har¬</l>
<l>riet's talk, that goes into madness.</l>

<l>Mary. I thought myself free and wise. But</l>
<l>now I know that every woman who has ever</l>
<l>loved Is the slave of love. It is her nature.</l>
<l>She cannot share that which Is the very reason</l>
<l>of her being.    Men are different.</l>

<l>It is the eternal tragedy of woman that she</l>
<l>is mated with her contradiction.    The man's</l>

<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>need for change Is unnatural, It Is monstrous to</l>
<l>the woman.</l>

<l>Shelley. What strange, false doctrine on</l>
<l>your lips! You strain and wrest your words</l>
<l>out of sheer anguish, as though Indeed your</l>
<l>time had come. What If this is indeed to be a</l>
<l>birth            for the new child .     . Freedom!</l>

<l>Mary. Freedom! O that Is the word you</l>
<l>are all always saying! A woman must not hold</l>
<l>a man from his freedom—with other women.</l>
<l>I know it is what I too, have thought and said.</l>
<l>But now I know, I do not understand I only</l>
<l>know—it Is a lie. Until men get beyond the</l>
<l>Illusions of their desires, no happiness can be</l>
<l>secure for women. There can be no real free¬</l>
<l>dom : no abiding vision of the truth. A woman</l>
<l>who loves as I do, cannot feel otherwise than</l>
<l>as I.</l>

<l>It Is the very deepest of my being that cries</l>
<l>out against this wandering, this prostitution of</l>
<l>the man, always pursuing some new pleasure,</l>
<l>worshipping at some new altar, never finally</l>
<l>faithful to any one. Whereas a woman, when</l>
<l>she gives herself to love, gives Irrevocably.</l>
<l>There Is no withholding, no duplication pos¬</l>
<l>sible. It Is her life, total and single, that she</l>
<l>gives. She can no more share it with another</l>
<l>woman than she can share her body and soul.</l>

<l>no</l>

<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>You give yourself, for to-day. I give myself</l>
<l>for ever. To-morrow you can give yourself</l>
<l>again, as though It were a new self. I can</l>
<l>never take myself away from you to give my¬</l>
<l>self again.</l>

<l>You have finished with my gift . . it</l>
<l>ceases to have value. It is no good any more.</l>
<l>It cannot be offered to another. I must find a</l>
<l>different way of living: and once a woman has</l>
<l>been loved, other ways of living are but degrees</l>
<l>of death. Harriet's way was the best. But it</l>
<l>Is not for me.</l>

<l>Shelley.    False! False!</l>

<l>Mary.   No, Shelley, It is true.</l>

<l>Shelley.   Wickedly false.</l>

<l>Mary.   For you!</l>

<l>Shelley. For you, Mary: most of all for</l>
<l>you.</l>

<l>Mary. I have always wanted you to be free.</l>
<l>I am my mother's daughter.            Let us be</l>

<l>reasonable.   It Is hard for you too.   When we</l>
<l>are older and the fires have burnt out . . .</l>

<l>Shelley. The fires will never burn out! O,</l>
<l>Death may quench this little candle that floats</l>
<l>upon Its dark pool: but as long as there Is being</l>
<l>anywhere this fire that Is both my spirit and</l>
<l>yours—our fire—will burn ever fierceller,</l>
<l>fiercelier! . . .</l>

<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>Mary. Aren't we wandering from actuality?</l>
<l>I should not have said "fire": when this sex-</l>
<l>passion has died down in you</l>

<l>Shelley. Why are you poisoning my soul</l>
<l>with worldly thoughts? When one body is</l>
<l>done our love will take another: the fire must</l>
<l>have Its flame. While ever life goes on there</l>
<l>must be attraction and fertilisation and birth.</l>
<l>Ever new attraction and new birth. But never</l>
<l>—O never—with denial and treachery to the</l>
<l>old. Always and only as a consequence of the</l>
<l>old. I love, because I love you, not because</l>
<l>once I loved you. You have lighted in me this</l>
<l>that cannot be extinguished: a passion you your¬</l>
<l>self cannot, may not now withhold. It is in¬</l>
<l>deed I that love, but It Is not merely I; it is we.</l>
<l>You cannot take yourself away.</l>

<l>Mary. I cannot take myself away, and I do</l>
<l>not love her. Your Emilia Is nothing to me, but</l>
<l>I must give you to her. I must share with a</l>
<l>mere stranger what Is nearer to me than my</l>
<l>flesh.</l>

<l>Shelley.  Yes—^you must share.</l>

<l>Mary. But how, Shelley—how can I learn</l>
<l>this?   It is impossible.    I cannot.            If only</l>

<l>it were some natural necessity! But we are</l>
<l>young yet, you and I. Our children are but</l>
<l>babes.</l>

<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>You are more fortunate than most men who</l>
<l>are born to love, because you have your art:</l>
<l>you can find vent there too for passion.</l>

<l>O If only she were real to me: this convent</l>
<l>girl, this half-woman, who feeds her sick fancies</l>
<l>upon your emotion. She Is but little better than</l>
<l>a ghost; and it is horrible to me that you should</l>
<l>squander upon her all the treasure of sunshine</l>
<l>that we two have gathered into this focus of our</l>
<l>love. I gave myself to you, but not for her,</l>
<l>Shelley, not for her.</l>

<l>Shelley. You gave yourself to Love, never</l>
<l>to me. Who am I that I should accept an</l>
<l>idolatrous gift? Who am I that I should take</l>
<l>you for my own, or offer myself so, to you or</l>
<l>to another? As a companion, as a lover, as a</l>
<l>comrade in freedom, as a partner in life's enter¬</l>
<l>prise,—O yes, yes!—^but that is not what you</l>
<l>are saying.</l>

<l>We dedicated our love to freedom, having</l>
<l>first dedicated to freedom our own souls. You</l>
<l>are not mine, nor am I yours, save only In that.</l>
<l>We have no use for one another, save In that.</l>
<l>Any other thought is abominable to me—and to</l>
<l>you!</l>

<l>And Emilia, she also belongs to freedom, as</l>
<l>do we. It Is In that I meet and am joined with</l>
<l>her.    Where we meet, where we love, where</l>

<l>"3</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>we are one delight together, there is free¬</l>
<l>dom. .</l>

<l>Do not misunderstand. You have no right</l>
<l>to misunderstand what you yourself have made</l>
<l>me realise; freedom Is the life of that In us</l>
<l>which has the right, the power, the duty to be</l>
<l>free. When I say I am joined with her in free¬</l>
<l>dom, I say It out of the world of Inspiration. I</l>
<l>tell the last truth. Something of me that, with¬</l>
<l>out her, was blind and dumb, finds sight and</l>
<l>speech because of her. I love her by necessity,</l>
<l>as I love you. We share together In a life</l>
<l>which becomes conscious and creative In so far</l>
<l>as we dare love one another, as we dare to be</l>
<l>joined and mingled In its being.</l>

<l>Mary. I feel that you are telling the truth.</l>
<l>But is it all the truth? What Is this In my soul</l>
<l>that resists and denies—that forces me to con¬</l>
<l>test your words?</l>

<l>I had always thought of myself as free, and</l>
<l>giving freedom. But now I know that this Is</l>
<l>what I really am.</l>

<l>O, why can I not love Emilia? My deepest</l>
<l>being longs for you to have all that life can</l>
<l>give.   But not from her, never from her!</l>

<l>Shelley. She is unreal to you, and so my</l>
<l>love for her is an unreal thing, a fever, an in¬</l>
<l>fatuation.     As  such  you  hate   and  struggle</l>

<l>114</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>against It—but with unreal weapons. Fighting</l>
<l>this that Is not, you too become false. And</l>
<l>because this love of mine is false to you, I too</l>
<l>have become to you unreal; to you whose in¬</l>
<l>tense reality is in your love, to you who only</l>
<l>hate this one thing, unreality.</l>

<l>Mary. Make me see her as you see her!</l>
<l>Save me from what I see! With my own eyes</l>
<l>I can see nothing in her upon which any rever¬</l>
<l>ence can take hold. If only I could realise a</l>
<l>spirit burning within her—and not be always</l>
<l>thrown back shivering from those chameleon</l>
<l>eyes, that bloodless skin, as from an empty</l>
<l>mask. If I could feel her alive behind those</l>
<l>fanciful words she marries so easily with yours!</l>

<l>Shelley. If you could see Emilia you would</l>
<l>understand, because you too would love her.</l>

<l>Mary. O if I could.   But what an "If" !</l>

<l>Shelley. You will begin to believe in her.</l>
<l>You will challenge every day this mask till it</l>
<l>yields Its reality to you. Because I love her,</l>
<l>because you cannot doubt I love her, you too</l>
<l>will Inevitably begin to know and love her. You</l>
<l>shake your head, Mary—and yet your eyes</l>
<l>shine.</l>

<l>Mary. I think I shall never be able to see</l>
<l>her as you do. Our relation will never be like</l>
<l>yours: and only, perhaps, In such a relation can</l>



<pb n=""/>



<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>her spirit reveal Itself. I must be content never</l>
<l>to understand. And It may be my love for you</l>
<l>will be strong enough even for this last giving</l>
<l>up to Love.</l>

<l>Shelley. To love Is always to have faith,</l>
<l>always to have more faith and more.</l>

<l>Mary. But this growth in faith demands a</l>
<l>struggle in the soul that Is little removed from</l>
<l>actual madness. At times the creative forces of</l>
<l>one's passion make one blind, make one cruel,</l>
<l>so tremendous Is their struggle with the stub¬</l>
<l>born substance of one's soul. One suffers till</l>
<l>one loses hold of oneself. There are moments</l>
<l>when I know I am not myself—moments In</l>
<l>which I could hurt you, you who are so much</l>
<l>dearer to me even than our children. What Is</l>
<l>it—tell me what It Is, my dear!</l>

<l>Shelley. It Is the birth-pains of the God.</l>
<l>And who shall win to liberty save by this mor¬</l>
<l>tal way? Only through a sort of madness can</l>
<l>we be sufficiently withdrawn from the grasp of</l>
<l>our selves for this new spirit to take possession</l>
<l>of us. To be shewn the throes of that new</l>
<l>birth taking hold upon and shaping a beloved</l>
<l>soul, this utterly humbles as it purely exalts the</l>
<l>spirit.</l>

<l>Mary. I have always wanted to pay the</l>
<l>price.    I think I have never really wanted any</l>

<l>THE PRICE OF FREEDOM</l>

<l>happiness except upon these terms. Well have</l>
<l>I known there was a kind of happiness that</l>
<l>might indeed be otherwise won and conferred,</l>
<l>but never the reality that alone I sought after,—</l>
<l>the final good which a man may obtain In ex¬</l>
<l>change for himself. If he keep back a penny it</l>
<l>can never be his. For either the deed is whole,</l>
<l>or it is a cheat. The payment is without with¬</l>
<l>holding, or it Is without avail. For this is just.</l>
<l>O above all else I have loved justice, for the</l>
<l>sake of Love.</l>

<l>Shelley. Without It there could be no free¬</l>
<l>dom. Freedom Is a perfect and final thing even</l>
<l>as death and birth are In their order final. And</l>
<l>Freedom goes beyond them. It Is eternal life.</l>
<l>It is immediate participation In the Integrity of</l>
<l>God himself.</l>

<l>Mary. But never without justice: never</l>
<l>without wanting to pay the price.</l>

<l>Greeting to America Enter¬</l>
<l>ing the War</l>

<l>A BOY, I dreamed that out of Liverpool</l>
<l>I sailed adventuring to the West.    Ro¬</l>
<l>mance</l>
<l>Presently led me thither, and th' expanse</l>
<l>Of your wide world of freedom did not fool</l>
<l>My April dream.   Anew, I went to school</l>
<l>To wonder, for I saw all circumstance</l>
<l>Growing obedient to man's spirit, and chance</l>
<l>I saw you take, as It had been a tool.</l>
<l>But now, America, that we are set</l>
<l>Together down, commensal with the worm</l>
<l>At the feast of Slaughter, you have put a term</l>
<l>To all my faith's shortcoming; you have met</l>
<l>Our will with yours. Implacable to affirm</l>
<l>The whole of freedom that was never yet.</l>

<l>the snow</l>
<l>And all her beauty of ploughed and fallow,</l>

<l>ochre and red,</l>
<l>Nourishes me anew.  Thy love is all about me.</l>
<l>More intimately near my spirit than the flesh</l>
<l>Wherein I live and move and have my daily</l>

<l>being.</l>
<l>For only in the enabling presence of thy love</l>
<l>I can become myself, that else with alien speech</l>

<l>me.</l>
<l>Within thy love my spirit is confident, at home</l>
<l>As I was never yet in mind or body of mine;</l>
<l>For thou embracest me with that which is not</l>

<l>strange</l>
<l>To my imprisoned spirit, bewildered in the mesh</l>
<l>Of this incomprehensible, this unfamiliar world,</l>
<l>That by the magic of thy love is changed for me</l>
<l>Into a welcoming presence, friendly and won¬</l>
<l>derful.</l>
