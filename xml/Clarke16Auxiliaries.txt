<l n="1">W<hi rend="smallcaps">herever</hi> war, with its red woes,</l>
<l>Or flood, or fire, or famine goes,</l>
<l>There, too, go I;</l>
<l>If earth in any quarter quakes</l>
<l>Or pestilence its ravage makes,</l>
<l>Thither I fly.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I kneel behind the soldier's trench,</l>
<l>I walk 'mid shambles' smear and stench,</l>
<l>The dead I mourn;</l>
<l>I bear the stretcher and I bend</l>
<l>O'er Fritz and Pierre and Jack to mend</l>
<l>What shells have torn.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I go wherever men may dare,</l>
<l>I go wherever woman's care</l>
<l>And love can live,</l>
<l>Wherever strength and skill can bring</l>
<l>Surcease to human suffering,</l>
<l>Or solace give.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I helped upon Haldora's shore;</l>
<l>With Hospitaller Knights I bore</l>
<l>The first red cross;</l>
<l>I was the Lady of the Lamp;</l>
<l>I saw in Solferino's camp</l>
<l>The crimson loss.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="188"/>
<l>I am your pennies and your pounds;</l>
<l>I am your bodies on their rounds</l>
<l>Of pain afar;</l>
<l>I am <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, doing what you would</l>
<l>If you were only where you could --</l>
<l>Your avatar.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The cross which on my arm I wear,</l>
<l>The flag which o'er my breast I bear,</l>
<l>Is but the sign</l>
<l>Of what you'd sacrifice for him</l>
<l>Who suffers on the hellish rim</l>
<l>Of war's red line.</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">A<hi rend="smallcaps">mbassador</hi> of Christ you go</l>
<l>Up to the very gates of Hell,</l>
<l>Through fog of powder, storm of shell,</l>
<l>To speak your Master's message: "Lo,</l>
<l>The Prince of Peace is with you still,</l>
<l>His peace be with you, His good-will."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It is not small, your priesthood's price,</l>
<l>To be a man and yet stand by,</l>
<l>To hold your life while others die,</l>
<l>To bless, not share the sacrifice,</l>
<l>To watch the strife and take no part --</l>
<l>You with the fire at your heart.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="189"/>
<l>But yours, for our great Captain Christ,</l>
<l>To know the sweat of agony,</l>
<l>The darkness of Gethsemane,</l>
<l>In anguish for these souls unpriced.</l>
<l>Vicegerent of God's pity you,</l>
<l>A sword must pierce your own soul through.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In the pale gleam of new-born day,</l>
<l>Apart in some tree-shadowed place,</l>
<l>Your altar but a packing-case,</l>
<l>Rude as the shed where Mary lay,</l>
<l>Your sanctuary the rain-drenched sod,</l>
<l>You bring the kneeling soldier God.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As sentinel you guard the gate</l>
<l>'Twixt life and death, and unto death</l>
<l>Speed the brave soul whose failing breath</l>
<l>Shudders not at the grip of Fate,</l>
<l>But answers, gallant to the end,</l>
<l>"Christ is the Word -- and I his friend."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then God go with you, priest of God,</l>
<l>For all is well and shall be well.</l>
<l>What though you tread the roads of Hell,</l>
<l>Your Captain these same ways has trod.</l>
<l>Above the anguish and the loss</l>
<l>Still floats the ensign of His Cross.</l></lg>

<l>In the battles of the night.</l>
<l>'Mid the roar and the reeling shadows of blood</l>
<l>They were moving like light,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Light of the reason, guarded</l>
<l>Tense within the will,</l>
<l>As a lantern under a tossing of boughs</l>
<l>Burns steady and still.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>With scrutiny calm, and with fingers</l>
<l>Patient as swift</l>
<l>They bind up the hurts and the pain-writhen</l>
<l>Bodies uplift,</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="191"/>
<l>Untired and defenceless; around them</l>
<l>With shrieks in its breath</l>
<l>Bursts stark from the terrible horizon</l>
<l>Impersonal death;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But they take not their courage from anger</l>
<l>That blinds the hot being;</l>
<l>They take not their pity from weakness;</l>
<l>Tender, yet seeing;</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Feeling, yet nerved to the uttermost;</l>
<l>Keen, like steel;</l>
<l>Yet the wounds of the mind they are stricken with,</l>
<l>Who shall heal?</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They endure to have eyes of the watcher</l>
<l>In hell, and not swerve</l>
<l>For an hour from the faith that they follow,</l>
<l>The light that they serve.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Man true to man, to his kindness</l>
<l>That overflows all,</l>
<l>To his spirit erect in the thunder</l>
<l>When all his forts fall, --</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>This light, in the tiger-mad welter,</l>
<l>They serve and they save.</l>
<l>What song shall be worthy to sing of them --</l>
<l>Braver than the brave?</l></lg>
