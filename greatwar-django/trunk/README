use the app to manage the eXist index configuration. For more
information on existdb index commands::

     $ ./manage.py help existdb_index
     $ ./manage.py help existdb_reindex

For a first-time install, you will should run these two steps: 
(Note that if all finding aids are loaded, the reindex step can take quite a while)::

     $ ./manage.py existdb_reindex
