<l rend="indent2">And the cool evening's benison;</l>
<l>By the last sunset touch that lay</l>
<l rend="indent2">Upon the hills when day was done:</l>
<l>By beauty lavishly outpoured,</l>
<l rend="indent2">And blessings carelessly received, </l>
<l>By all the days that I have lived,</l>

<l rend="indent2">With high endeavor that was his,</l> 
<l>By all his mad catastrophes,</l>

<lg>
<l>I, that on my familiar hill</l>
<l rend="indent2">Saw with uncomprehending eyes</l> 
<l>A hundred of Thy sunsets spill</l>
<l rend="indent2">Their fresh and sanguine sacrifice,</l> 
<l>Ere the sun swings his noonday sword</l>

<l rend="indent4">Not even ruthless war could hide from view</l>
<l rend="indent4">The smiling fields where crimson poppies grew,</l> 
<l>Nor mar the sunset's rose and purple dyes;</l>

<l rend="indent4">To hear grapepickers sing, although they knew</l> 
<l rend="indent4">Just on the other sidethe cannon threw</l> 
<l>Their deadly shells and woke the startled skies.</l></lg>

<l>But over all that made Champagne so fair,</l>

<l n="1">The little home paper comes to me, </l>
<l>As badly printed as it can be; </l>
<l>It's ungrammatical, cheap, absurd--</l>
<l>Yet, how I love each intimate word! </l>
<l>For here am I in the teeming town, </l>
<l>Where the sad, mad people rush up and down, </l>
<l>And it's good to get back to the old lost place, </l>
<l>And gossip and smile for a little space.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The weather is hot; the corn crop's good;</l>
<l>They've had a picnic in Sheldon's Wood. </l>
<l>And Aunt Maria was sick last week</l>
<l>Ike Morrison's got a swollen cheek, </l>
<l>And the Squire was hurt in a runaway--</l>
<l>More shocked than bruised, I'm glad they say. </l>
<l>Bert Wills--I used to play with him--</l>
<l>Is working a farm with his Uncle Jim.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The Red Cross ladies gave a tea,</l>
<l>And raised quite a bit. Old Sol MacPhee </l>
<l>Has sold his house on Lincoln Road--</l>
<l>He couldn't carry so big a load. </l>
<l>The methodist minister's had a call </l>
<l>From a wealthy parish near St. Paul. </l>
<l>And old Herb Sweet is married at last--</l>
<l>He was forty-two. How the years rush past!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>But here's an item that makes me see </l>
<l>What a puzzling riddle life can be. </l>
<l>"Ed Stokes", it reads, "was killed in France </l>
<l>When the Allies made their last advance."</l><pb n="16"/>
<l>Ed Stokes! That boy with the laughing eyes </l>
<l>As blue as the early--summer skies! </l>
<l>He wouldn't have killed a fly--and yet, </l>
<l>Without a murmur, without a regret,</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He left the peace of our little place, </l>
<l>And went away with a light in his face; </l>
<l>For out in the world was a job to do, </l>
<l>And he wouldn't come home until it was through! </l>
<l>Four thousand mires from our tiny town </l>
<l>And its hardware store, this boy went down. </l>
<l>Such a quiet lad, such a simple chap--</l>
<l>But he's put East Dunkirk on the map!</l></lg></div>

<l n="1">No Man's Land is an eerie sight</l>
<l>At early dawn in the pale gray light.</l>
<l>Never a house and never a hedge </l>
<l>In No Man's Land from edge to edge,</l>
<l>And never a living soul walks there </l>
<l>To taste the fresh of the morning air. </l>
<l>Only some lumps of rotting clay,</l>
<l>That were friends or foemen yesterday</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>What are the bounds of No Man's Land? </l>
<l>You can see them clearly on either hand,</l>
<l>A mound of rag-bags gray in the sun, </l>
<l>Or a furrow of brown where the earthworks run </l>
<l>From the Eastern hills to the Western sea,</l>
<l>Through field or forest, o'er river and lea </l>
<l>No man may pass them, but aim you well</l>
<l>And death rides across on the bullet or shell.</l></lg>
<pb n="17"/>

<lg>
<l>But No Man's Land is a goblin sight </l>
<l>When patrols crawl over at dead o' night; </l>
<l>Boche or British, Belgian or French, </l>
<l>You dice with death when you cross the trench. </l>
<l>When the "rapid," like fireflies in the dark, </l>
<l>Flits down the parapet spark by spark, </l>
<l>And you drop for cover to keep your head </l>
<l>With your face on the breast of the four months' dead.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The man who ranges in No Man's Land </l>
<l>Is dogged by the shadows on either hand </l>
<l>When the starshell's flare, as it bursts o'erhead, </l>
<l>Scares the great gray rats that feed on the dead, </l>
<l>And the bursting bomb or the bayonet--snatch </l>
<l>May answer the click of your safety--catch. </l>
<l>For the lone patrol, with his life in his hand, </l>
<l>Is hunting for blood in No Man's Land.</l></lg></div>

<l n="1">T'he star upon their service flag has changed to gleaming gold;</l>
<l>It speaks no more of hope and life, as once it did of old, </l>
<l>But splendidly it glistens now for every eye to see</l>
<l>And softly whispers: "Here lived one who died for liberty.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>"Here once he walked and played and laughed, here oft his smile was known;</l>
<l>Within these walls today are kept the toys he used to own.</l>
<l>Now I am he who marched away and I am he who fell</l>
<l> Of service once I spoke, but now of sacrifice I tell.</l><pb n="18"/>
<l>"No richer home in all this land is there than this I grace,</l>
<l>For here was cradled manhood fine; within this humble place</l>
<l>A soldier for the truth was born, and here, beside the door,</l>
<l>A mother sits and grieves for him who shall return no</l>
<l>more.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>''Salute me, stranger, as you pass! I mark a soldier who </l>
<l>Gave up the joys of living here, to dare and die for you!</l>
<l>This is the home that once he knew, who fought for you and fell;</l>
<l>This is a shrine of sacrifice, where faith and courage dwell."</l></lg></div>

<l n="1">I have a conversation book; I brought it out from home.</l>
<l>It tells you the French for knife and fork and likewise brush and comb</l>
<l>It learns you how to ask the time, the names of all the stars</l>
<l>And how to order oysters and how to buy cigars.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>But there ain't no stores to buy in; there ain't no big hotels,</l>
<l>When you spend your time in dugouts doing a wholesale trade in shells;</l>
<l>It's nice to know the proper talk for theatres and such,</l>
<l>But when it comes to talking, why, it doesn't help you much.</l>
<l>There's all them friendly kind o' things you'd naturally say</l>
<l>When you meet a feller casual like and pass the time o' day.</l>
<l>'l'hem little things that breaks the ice and kind of clears the air.</l>
<l>But when you lose your French book, why, them things isn't there.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>I met a chap the other day a--rootin' in a trench,</l>
<l>He didn't know a word of ours, nor me a word of French</l>
<l>And how we ever managed, well, I cannot understand,</l>
<l>But I never used my French book though I had it in my hand.</l>
<l>I winked at him to start with; he grinned from ear to ear; </l>
<l>An' he says, "Bong Jour, Sammy," an' I says "Souvenir";</l>
<l>He took my only cigarette, I took his thin cigar,</l><pb n="20"/>
<l>Which set the ball a--rollin', and so--well, there you are!</l>
<l>I showed him next my wife and kids; he up and showed me his,</l>
<l>Them funny little French kids with hair all in a frizz;</l>
<l>"Annette," he says, "Louise," he says, and his tears begin to fall;</l>
<l>We was comrades when we parted, though we'd hardly spoke at all.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>He'd have kissed me if I'd let him. We had never met before,</l>
<l>And I've never seen the beggar since, for that's the way of war;</l>
<l>And though we scarcely spoke a word, I wonder just the same</l>
<l>If he'll ever see them kids of his--I never asked his name.</l></lg></div>

<l n="1">HO! Heimdal sounds the Gjallar-horn: </l>
<l>The hosts of Hel rush forth </l>
<l>And Fenris rages redly </l>
<l>From his shackles in the North </l>
<l>Unleashed is Garm, and Lok is loosed, </l>
<l>And freed is Giant Rime; </l>
<l>The Rainbow-bridge is broken </l>
<l>By the hordes of Muspelheim. </l>
<l>The wild Valkyries ride the wind </l>
<l>With spear and clanging shield </l>
<l>Where all the Hates embattled </l>
<l>Are met on Vigrid-field; </l>
<l>For there shall fall the Mighty Ones </l>
<l>By valiant men adored--</l>
<l>Great Odin, Tyr the fearless, </l>
<l>And Frey that sold his sword. .</l>
<l>And Thor shall slay the dragon </l>
<l>Whose breath shall be his bane. </l>
<l>The gods themselves shall perish: </l>
<l>The sons of the gods shall reign!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Old Time shall sound the boding horn </l>
<l>Again and yet again, rouse the warring passions </l>
<l>That swell the hearts of men. </l>
<l>Revolt shall wake, and Anarchy, </l>
<l>With all their horrid throng--</l>
<l>Revenge, Destruction Rapine,</l><pb n="22"/>
<l>The spawn of ancient Wrong, </l>
<l>With all the hosts of slaughter </l>
<l>That our own sins must breed-</l>
<l>Cold Hate, Oppression's daughter, </l>
<l>And Rage, the child of Greed. </l>
<l>Then, though we stand to battle </l>
<l>As men have ever stood, </l>
<l>Down, down shall crash our temples, </l>
<l>The Evil and the Good; </l>
<l>Yea, all that now we cherish </l>
<l>Must pass--but not in vain. </l>
<l>The gods we love shall perish; </l>
<l>The sons of the gods shall reign!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>So, strong in faith, or weak in doubt, </l>
<l>Or berserk-mad, we range </l>
<l>Our spears in that long battle </l>
<l>Which means not Death, but Change. </l>
<l>Our highest with our lowest </l>
<l>Must own the grim behest, </l>
<l>And Good shall yield for Better--</l>
<l>Else how should come the Best? </l>
<l>Yet if we win our portion </l>
<l>How dare we crave the whole? </l>
<l>And if we still press forward, </l>
<l>Why need we know the goal? </l>
<l>But those whose hearts are constant </l>
<l>And those whose souls are wise</l>
<l> Have said that from our ashes .</l>
<l>A nobler race shall rise </l>
<l>From shreds of shattered altars </l>
<l>To rear the Perfect Fane. </l>
<l>Our little gods must perish </l>
<l>That God I himself shall reign!</l></lg>

<l rend="indent2">Stepped out for the Flag today.</l>

<l rend="indent2">Stood forth with patriot-joy</l>

<note place="inline">This poem is one of many that were written to commemorate the stubborn bravery of the Anzacs, the British soldiers from Australia and New Zealand. These indomitables came half way round the globe at Britain's first call. Their first appearance was in Egypt, where they drove the German--led Turks back into the desert and saved the Suez canal. They were and are officially designated the "Australian and New Zealand Army Corps," a title too long for common use. They have won fame and the world's admiration as the "Anzacs." a word made by running together the first letters of their official title. Australia's own name for her soldier is Bill--Jim. 'The Graves of Gallipoli" is one of the most noble and tender poems that have come to us out of the war</note>

<l n="1">THE herdman wandering by the lonely rills</l>
<l>Marks where they lie on the scarred mountain's flanks,</l>

<l>Surged upward from the sea.</l></lg><pb n="28"/>

<l>None tends them. Flowers will come again in spring, </l>
<l>And the torn hills and those poor mounds be green. </l>
<l>Some bird that sings in English woods may sing </l>
<l>To English lads beneath--the wind will keep</l>
<l>Its ancient lullaby.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Some flower that blooms beside the southern foam</l>
<l>May blossom where our dead Australians lie, </l>
<l>And comfort them with whispers of their home; </l>
<l>And they will dream, beneath the alien sky, </l>
<l>Of the Pacific Sea.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>"Thrice happy they who fell beneath the walls, </l>
<l>Under their father's eves," the Trojan said, </l>
<l>"Not we who die in exile where who falls </l>
<l>Must lie in foreign earth." Alas! our dead </l>
<l>Lie buried far away</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet where the brave lies who fell in fight</l>
<l>For his dear country, there his country is. </l>
<l>And we will mourn them proudly as of right--</l>
<l>For meaner deaths be weeping and loud cries: </l>
<l>They died pro patria!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Oh, sweet and seemly so to die, indeed, </l>
<l>In the high flush of youth and strength and pride. </l>
<l>These are our martyrs, and their blood the seed </l>
<l>Of nobler futures. 'Twas for us they died. </l>
<l>Keep we their memory green.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>This be their epitaph. "Traveler, south or west, </l>
<l>Go, say at home we heard the trumpet call, </l>
<l>And answered. Now beside the sea we rest. </l>
<l>Our end was happy if our country thrives: </l>
<l>Much was demanded. Lo! our store was small--</l>
<l>That which we had we gave--it was our lives."</l></lg><pb n="29"/></div>

<l n="1">IT was thick with Prussian troopers, it was foul with German guns;</l>
<l>Every tree that cast a shadow was a sheltering place for Huns.</l>
<l>Death was guarding every roadway, death was watching every field,</l>
<l>And behind each rise of terrain was a rapid-fire concealed</l>
<l>But Uncle Sam's Marines had orders: "Drive the Boche from where they're hid. </l>
<l>For the honor of Old Glory, take the woods!" and so they did.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>I fancy none will tell it as the story should be told--</l>
<l>None will ever do full justice to those Yankee troopers bold.</l>
<l>How they crawled upon their stomachs through the fields of golden wheat</l>
<l>With the bullets spitting at them in that awful battle heat.</l>
<l>It's a tale too big for writing; it's beyond the voice or pen,</l>
<l>But it glows among the splendor of the bravest deeds men.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>It's recorded as a battle, but I fancy it will live,</l>
<l>As the brightest gem of courage human struggles have to give.</l>
<l>Inch by inch, they crawled to victory toward the flaming mounts of guns;</l>
<l>Inch by inch, they crawled to grapple with the barricaded Huns</l></lg><pb n="30"/>
<lg>
<l>On through fields that death was sweeping with a murderous fire,
they went</l>
<l>Till the Teuton line was vanquished and the German strength was spent.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Ebbed and flowed the tides of battle as they've seldom done before;</l>
<l>Slowly, surely, moved the Yankees against all the odds of war.</l>
<l>For the honor of the fallen, for the glory of the dead,</l>
<l>The living line of courage kept the faith and moved ahead.</l>
<l>'They'd been ordered not to falter, and when night came on they stood</l>
<l>With Old Glory proudly flying o'er the trees of Belleau Wood.</l></lg></div>

<lg>
<l n="1">It was the high midsummer, and the sun was shining strong,</l>
<l>And the lane was rather flinty, and the lane was rather long,</l>
<l>When--up and down the gentle hills beside the stripling Test--</l>
<l>I chanced to come to Bullington and stayed a while to rest.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>It was drowned in peace and quiet, as the river reeds are drowned</l>
<l>In the water clear as crystal, flowing by with scarce a sound,</l>
<l>And the air was like a posy with the sweet haymaking smells,</l>
<l>And the Roses and Sweet Williams and Canterbury Bells.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Far away as some strange planet seemed the old world's dust and din,</l>
<l>And the trout in sun--warmed shallows hardly seemed to stir a fin;</l>
<l>And there's never a clock to tell you how the hurrying world goes on</l>
<l>In the little ivied steeple down in drowsy Bullington.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Small and sleepy, there it nestled, seeming far from hastening Time,</l>
<l>As a teeny-tiny village in some quaint old nursery rhyme;</l>
<l>And a teeny-tiny river by a teeny--tiny weir </l>
<l>Sang a teeny-tiny ditty that I stayed a while to hear.</l></lg><pb n="35"/>
<lg>
<l>"Oh, the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,</l>
<l>But the reedy banks of Bullington are good enough for me;</l>
<l>Oh, the lane runs to the highway, and the highway o'er the down,</l>
<l>But it's better here in Bullington than there in London town."</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Then high above an aeroplane in humming flight went by,</l>
<l>With the droning of its engines filling all the cloudless sky,</l>
<l>And like the booming of a knell across that perfect day</l>
<l>There came the gun's dull thunder from the ranges far away</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>And while I lay and listened, oh, the river's sleepy tune</l>
<l>Seemed to change its rippling music, like the cuckoo's stave in June;</l>
<l>And the cannon's distant thunder, and the engines' warlike drone</l>
<l>Seemed to mingle with its burthen in a solemn undertone.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>"Oh, the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,</l>
<l>And there's war on land and water, and there's work for you and me!</l>
<l>And on many a field of glory there are gallant lives laid down</l>
<l>As well for tiny Bullington as mighty London town!"</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>So I roused me from my daydream, for I knew the song spoke true</l>
<l>That it isn't time for dreaming while there's duty still to do;</l>
<l>And I turned into the highway where it meets the flinty lane,</l>
<l>And world of wars and sorrows was about me once again.

<note place="inline">"Shavetail" is a name applied by enlisted men in the regular army to lieutenants fresh from West Point.</note>
<lg>
<l n="1">TWENTY years of the army, of drawing a sergeant's pay</l>
<l rend="indent2">And helping the West Point shavetails, fresh from
the training school</l>
<l>To handle a bunch of soldiers and drill 'em the proper way</l>
<l rend="indent2">(Which isn't always exactly according to book and rule).</l>
<l>I've seen 'em rise to Captains and Majors and Colonels, too,</l>
<l rend="indent2">And me still only a sergeant, the same as I used to be,</l>
<l>And I knew that some of them didn't know as much as a sergeant knew,</l>
<l rend="indent2">But I stuck to my daily duty--there wasn't a growl
from me</l></lg>
<lg rend="center">
<l>Twenty years of the army, </l>
<l rend="indent2">Serving in peace and war,</l>
<l>Standing the drill of the army mill,</l>
<l rend="indent2">For that's what they paid me for</l></lg><pb n="39"/>
<lg>
<l>Twenty years with the army, which wasn't so much for size,</l>
<l rend="indent2">But man for man I'd back it to lick any troops on earth.</l>
<l>'Twas a proud little classy army, as good as the flag it flies,</l>
<l rend="indent2">And it takes an old top sergeant to know what the
flag is worth.</l>
<l>Then--a shot at Sarejevo, and hell burst over there</l>
<l rend="indent2">And the kaiser dragged us in it, and the bill for
the draf was passed</l>
<l>And --they handed me my commission, and some shoulder straps to wear,</l>
<l rend="indent2">And the crazy dream of my rooky days had changed to a fact at last.</l></lg>
<lg rend="center">
<l>Twenty years with the army, </l>
<l rend="indent2">And it's great to know they call </l>
<l>On the guys like me for what will be</l>
<l rend="indent2">The mightiest job of all.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Twenty years of the army, of doing what shavetails bid,</l>
<l rend="indent2">And I know I haven't the polish that fellows like that will show,</l>
<l>And I hold a high opinion of the brains of a West Point kid,</l>
<l rend="indent2">But I think I can make him hustle when it comes to the work I know.</l>
<l>But who cares where we come from, Plattsburg, ranks, or the Guard,</l>
<l rend="indent2">This isn't a pink tea-party, but a War to be fought and won;</l>
<l>There's a serious job before us, a job that is huge and hard,</l><pb n="40"/>
<l rend="indent2">And the social register don't count until we've got
it done!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Twenty years in the army,</l>
<l rend="indent2">And now I've got my chance.</l>
<l>Have I earned my straps? Well, you watch the chaps</l>
<l rend="indent2">That I've trained for the game in France!</l></lg></div>

<l n="1">IT'S a high-falutin' title they have handed us;</l>
<l>It's very complimentary and grand; </l>
<l>But a year or so ago they called us "hicks," you know--</l>

<l>Now it's, "Save the country, Farmer!</l>

Here, and in the neighboring island of Vido, many of them lied--to begin with, at the rate of hundreds a day. Some of them were buried at sea. Others lie in common graves. In the midst of he mounds which mark their resting--place, and which vary in size, here stands a cross. On it is a Serbian inscription, written by the poet, V. Stanimirovic, and translated for the London Westminster Gazette by Mr. L. F. Waring:</note>

<l n="1">THEY knew they were fighting our war. As the months grew to years</l>
<l>Their men and their women had watched through their blood and their tears</l>
<l>For a sign that we knew, we who could not have come to be free</l>
<l>Without France, long ago. And at last from the threatening sea</l>
<l>The stars of our strength on the eyes of their weariness rose</l>
<l>And he stood among them, the sorrow-strong hero we chose</l>
<l>To carry our flag to the tomb of that Frenchman whose name</l>
<l>A man of our country could once more pronounce without shame.</l>
<l>What crown of rich words would he set for all time on this day?</l>
<l>The past and the future were listening what he would say--</l>
<l>Only this, from the white--flaming heart of a passion austere,</l>
<l>Only this--ah, but France understood "Lafayette, we are here."

<note place="inline">Lieutenant Roche has deftly caught and preserved in words the strange vision of unannounced trains that flashed now and then post towns and villages bearing American troops from unknown camps to unknown ports of embarkation--the flash of faces of men about whom it was known only that they came from the shops and fields of home and were going across the seas to fight somewhere, for those who stood and gazed as they whirled by. The mystery, the roar of wheels, the eddying dust and the silence that followed infuse these lines with picture and sound that will stay in the minds of any who saw such trains go hurrying away.</note>

<l rend="indent">We have no doubts, we know that You are here.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>You helped us pass the jest along the trenches--</l>

<l rend="indent">You touched its ribaldry and made it fine.</l>
<l>You stood beside us in our pain and weakness--</l>
<l>We're glad to think You understand our weakness--</l>
<l rend="indent">Somehow it seems to help us not to whine.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>We think about You kneeling in the Garden--</l>
<l>Ah! God! the agony of that dread Garden--</l>
<l rend="indent">We know You prayed for us upon the Cross.</l>
<l>If anything could make us glad to bear it--</l>
<l>'Twould he the knowledge that You willed to bear it--</l>
<l rend="indent">Pain--death--the uttermost of human loss.</l></lg>

<l>We feel so sure that You will not forget us--</l>

<l rend="indent">We were showing all signs of distress.</l></lg>

<l>"I'd sent four of 'em back with the R. I. P. sign, </l>
<l rend="indent">Which means to return if you can,</l>

<lg>

<l rend="indent">That the chief was aware of our plight,</l>
<l>An' for us to hang onto the ditch that we held; </l>

<l>Then we stuck to our trench an' we stuck to our guns; </l>
<l rend="indent">You know how you'll fight when you know</l>

<l>'R. I. P. are my orders,' he answered them all,</l>

<note place="inline">"Doughboy" is an old nickname for a United States infantryman. When our army went into what is now New Mexico, Arizona and California to quiet the Mexicans hostilities that preceded the war of 1846, the infantry fell into a way of camping in houses built by the natives with sun--dried bricks of adobe mud. The cavalry, having to lie in the open with the horses, were joked thereat and came back by calling the infantry dobie boys. The name stuck and by an easy slide arrived at the present form.</note>
<lg>
<l n="1">MIKE DILLON was a doughboy </l>
<l rend="indent">And wore the issue stuff; </l>
<l>He wasn't much to look at--</l>
<l rend="indent">In fact, was rather rough;</l>
<l>He served his time as rookie</l>
<l rend="indent">At drilling in the sun, </l>
<l>And cleared a lot of timber</l>
<l rend="indent">And polished up his gun.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Mike Dillon was a private</l>
<l rend="indent">With all the word entails;</l><pb n="62"/>
<l>He cussed and chewed tobacco</l>
<l rend="indent">And overlooked his nails.</l>
<l>You never saw Mike Dillon</l>
<l rend="indent">At dances ultra nice;</l>
<l>In fact, inspection found him</l>
<l rend="indent">Enjoying body lice.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>If Mike had married money</l>
<l rend="indent">Or had a little drag,</l>
<l>He might have got a brevet</l>
<l rend="indent">And missed a little "fag"</l>
<l>But as a social figure</l>
<l rend="indent">He simply wasn't there--</l>
<l>So Mike continued drilling</l>
<l rend="indent">And knifing up his fare.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In course of time they shipped 'em</l>
<l rend="indent">And shipped 'em over where</l>
<l>A man like Mike can sidestep</l>
<l rend="indent">The frigid social stare,</l>
<l>And do the job of soldier</l>
<l rend="indent">Without the fancy frills,</l>
<l>And keep a steady footing</l>
<l rend="indent">In the pace that really kills.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now Mike did nothing special;</l>
<l rend="indent">He only did his best:</l>
<l>He stuck and "went on over"--</l>
<l rend="indent">And got it in the chest;</l>
<l>He played it fair and squarely</l>
<l rend="indent">Without a social air,</l>
<l>And Mike is now in heaven</l>
<l rend="indent">And at least a corporal there!

<l>And who would shrink from combat when, with brasses sounding strong,</l>
<l rend="indent">There is flung out on the breeze "La Marseillaise"?</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>When it starts to render "Sambre et Meuse," the march that won the day</l>

<l>The grey-green hosts of Hundom melt before the stern array</l>
<l rend="indent">Of our gallant sister-ally's blue-clad men.</l>
<l>And when it plays our Anthem, with rendition bold and clear--</l>

<lg>
<l>For it's olive-drab, horizon-blue, packed closely side by side,</l>

<l>And it's olive-drab, horizon-blue, whatever may betide,</l>

<l n="1">WE never were made to be seen on parade</l>
<l rend="indent">When sweethearts and such line the streets;</l>
<l>When the band starts to blare, look for us we ain't there--</l>
<l rend="indent">We're mussing around with the eats.</l>
<l>It's fun to step out to the echoing shout</l>
<l rend="indent">Of a crowd that forgets how you're fed,</l>
<l>While we're soiling our duds hacking eyes out of spuds--</l>
<l rend="indent">You know what Napoleon said.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When the mess sergeant's gay, you can bet hell's to pay</l>
<l rend="indent">For the boys who are standing in line;</l>
<l>When the boys get a square, then the sergeant is there</l>
<l rend="indent">With your death warrant ready to sign.</l>
<l>If you're long on the grub, then you're damned for a dub,</l>
<l rend="indent">If you're short, you're a miser instead,</l>
<l>But, however you feel, you must get the next meal--</l>
<l rend="indent">You know what Napoleon said.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>You think it's a cinch when you come to the clinch</l>
<l rend="indent">For the man who is grinding the meat;</l>
<l>In the heat of the fight, why the cook's out of sight</l>
<l rend="indent">With plenty of room to retreat</l><pb n="67"/>
<l>But a plump of a shell in a kitchen is hell </l>
<l rend="indent">When the roof scatters over your head,</l>
<l>And you crawl on your knees to pick up the K. P.'s--</l>
<l rend="indent">You know what Napoleon said.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>If the war ever ends, we'll go back to our friends--</l>
<l rend="indent">In the army we've nary a one;</l>
<l>We'll list to the prattle of this or that battle,</l>
<l rend="indent">And then, when the story is done,</l>
<l>We'll say, when they ask, "Now what was your task,</l>
<l rend="indent">And what is the glory you shed?"</l>
<l>"You see how they thrive--well, we kept 'em alive!</l>
<l rend="indent">You know what Napoleon said."

<l>And, when on a summer night </l>
<l>Moonlight drenched my clovers white,</l>

<lg>
<l>It may be that e'en to--night, </l>
<l>In the Gardens of Delight,</l>
<l rend="indent">Where his shining soul must dwell,</l>

<l>Years ago I went with Sherman to the ever sunny sea.</l>
<l>I stood my ground at Gettysburg, that bloody summer day,</l>
<l>When gallant Pickett rushed the hill and lost his boys in gray;</l>
<l>And now our starry banner is insulted and defied,</l>
<l>The kaiser tears it into shreds and glories in his pride;</l>
<l>Just pass the word across the sea to his stronghold of might,</l>
<l>And say that Danny Bloomer's here and not too old to fight.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>I gave my youth to Uncle Sam in years I'll ne'er forget,</l>
<l>In mem'ry of those stirring times my old blood tingles yet.</l>
<l>With four score years upon me I can lift the same old gun,</l>
<l>And to face our Flag's insulter will be everlasting fun.</l>
<l>Please say that Danny Bloomer is ready for the fray,</l>
<l>Cry "Forward, march!" and see him in the good old ranks today.</l>
<l>I love the flag of Washington because it stands for Right,</l>
<l>And that is why I tell you I am not too old to fight.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>'Tis true I'm somewhat crippled, but I do not care for that,</l>
<l>I feel as young as when I saw the tilt of Sherman's hat;</l>
<l>I want to do my duty again before I die,</l>
<l>And see Old Glory proudly in the streets of Berlin fly.</l><pb n="76"/>
<l>I do not know the kaiser, but I hope within a year</l>
<l>Amid the roar of cannon he will say, "Old Bloomer's here!" </l>
<l>Yes, hand me down a rifle and I will use it right, </l>
<l>Your Uncle Danny Bloomer isn't yet too old to fight.</l>
<l>We've borne their insults long enough--they make me long to go. '</l>
<l>I want to squint along my gun and aim it at the foe; </l>
<l>I eat the same old rations that I ate in '64, </l>
<l>And feel the blood of youth again amid the battle's roar. </l>
<l>I haven't long to tarry here until my work is done,</l>
<l>But I want to show the kaiser we're not in it for fun</l>
<l>So give me marching orders and I'll disappear from sight,</l>
<l>For I am Danny Bloomer, and I'm not too old to fight.

<lg>
<l n="1">MY son, at last the fateful day has come</l>
<l rend="indent">For us to part. The hours have nearly run.</l>
<l>May God return you safe to land and home;</l>
<l rend="indent">Yet, what God wills, so may His will be done.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Draw tight the belt about your slender frame;</l>
<l rend="indent">Flash blue your eyes! Hold high your proud young head!</l>
<l>Today you march in Liberty's fair name,</l>
<l rend="indent">To save the line enriched by France's dead!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I would not it were otherwise. And yet</l>
<l rend="indent">'Tis hard to speed your marching forth, my son!</l>
<l>'Tis doubly hard to live without regret</l>
<l rend="indent">For love unsaid, and kindnesses undone.</l></lg><pb n="88"/>

<lg>
<l>But would the chance were mine with you to stand</l>
<l rend="indent">Upon those shores and see our flag unfurled! </l>
<l>To fight on France's brave, unconquered land</l>
<l rend="indent">With Liberty's great sword for all the world!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Beyond the waves, my son, the siren calls,</l>
<l rend="indent">The sky is black and Fastnet lies abreast;</l>
<l>A signal rocket flings its stars and falls</l>
<l rend="indent">Across the night to welcome England's guest.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>When mid the scud you see the Cornish lights,</l>
<l rend="indent">And through the mist you hear faint Devon chimes, </l>
<l>I hank God for memories of those other nights</l>
<l rend="indent">And days on other ships in happier times.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Perhaps you'll stand within the pillared nave</l>
<l rend="indent">And aisles where colored sundust falls, and see </l>
<l>Old Canterbury Church where Becket gave</l>
<l rend="indent">His life's best blood for England's liberty!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Some night you'll walk, perhaps, on Salisbury plain </l>
<l rend="indent">Above Stonehenge the Druid's stars still sleep, </l>
<l>And on the turf within the circled fane</l>
<l rend="indent">Beneath the autumn moon still lie the sheep.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>And if you march beside some Kentish hedge,</l>
<l rend="indent">And blackberries hang thick clustered o'er the ways,</l>
<l>Hick down a branch! Rest by the road's brown edge;</l>
<l rend="indent">Eat! Nor forget our last vacation days!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>And then the trench in battle-scarred Lorraine;</l>
<l rend="indent">The town half burned but held in spite of hell;</l>
<l>The bridge twice taken, lost, and won again;</l>
<l rend="indent">The cratered glacis ripped with mine and shell.</l></lg><pb n="89"/>
<lg>
<l>The leafless trees, bare-branched in spite of June;</l>
<l rend="indent">The sodden road, the desolated plain;</l>
<l>The mateless birds, the season out of tune;</l>
<l rend="indent">Fair France, at bay, is calling through her pain.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Oh, son! My son! God keep you safe and free</l>
<l rend="indent">Our flag and you! But if the hour must come</l>
<l>To choose at last 'twixt self and liberty</l>
<l rend="indent">We'll close our eyes! So let God's will be done!

<note place="inline">From this author's 'Our Navy at Work," Published by the Bobbs-Merrill co. In 1917, our Government took over a large number of pleasure-yachts, fitted them with a few light guns and depth-charge and sent them into French waters to hunt submarines. They were variously known as "The Suicide Fleet" and "Easter-Eggs." Mr. Kauffman spent some time at sea with them. Permission to reproduce in this book.</note>

<lg>
<l n="1">I WAS an exile from my own country and wandered over the
breast of the world seeking another country.</l>
<l rend="indent">And I came into a land where there was only a long spring and a
long autumn, where they did not know the deadly heats of our summers
or the mortal colds of our mountains. Among the vines and sunny fields
I saw thepeople of this land at work, ever young of soul, smiling, loving, and kindly.</l>
<l rend="indent">I asked, "What is the name of this happy place?"</l>
<l rend="indent">And the answer was, "France the voluptuous."</l>
<l rend="indent">I came to towns of splendid monuments, of harmonious buildings, of
proud triumphal arches of the past, and above always I saw the spires
of great cathedrals stretching toward the sky, as if to seize upon the
feet of God.</l>
<l rend="indent">I asked, "What is the name of this marvelous land?"</l>
<l rend="indent">And the answer was, "France the glorious."</l>
<l rend="indent">I advanced again, when I was struck by the red color of a large
river. . . It was a river of warm blood that rolled down from afar in
thick and heavy waves.  I advanced again. Before me dark clouds of
smoke hid the endless sky above huge fields of warriors in battle;
when these died smiling at death others took their places, singing.</l>
<l rend="indent">I asked, "What is the name of this chivalrous land?"</l>
<l rend="indent">And the answer was, "France the courageous."</l>
<l rend="indent">At last I came to an immense city, of which I saw neither the
beginning nor the end, a city full of sumptuous palaces, of parks, and
fountains. The sun glistened on the marble of the streets and kissed
the serene, resigned<pb n="94"/>faces of women clothed in black. The

<note place="inline">The traditional friendship between the United States and France was recemented under the fire of German guns. In France they celebrated our Fourth of July; in this country, we celebrated the fourteenth of July, the anniversary of the fall of the Bastile. Yank and Poilu, are brothers in war, don't mind the languages. The inextinguishable humor of France never showed more quaintly than inthat word, "Poilu." It means "unshaven." More freely, "a man who needs a shave." A whimsical comment upon the French soldier's way of letting his beard grow while he is in the field. Those boys were like the English and our own. They smiled at misery. They were good old sports, bless 'em!</note>

<l>You were made for love and laughter, for good wine and merry song,</l>
<l rend="indent">Now your sunlit world has sadly gone astray, </l>
<l>And the road today you travel stretches rough and red and long,</l>

<lg>
<l>Though you live within the shadow, fagged and hungry half the while,</l>
<l rend="indent">And your days and nights are racking in the line,</l>
<l>There is nothing under heaven that can take away your smile,</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, so wistful, and so patient and so fine.</l>
<l>You are tender as a woman with the tiny ones who crowd</l>
<l rend="indent">To upraise their lips and for your kisses pout,</l>
<l>Still, we'd hate to have to face you when the bugle's sounding loud</l>

<l rend="indent">But that heart of yours is always twenty-one. </l>
<l>No you do not "parlee English," and you find it very hard,</l>
<l rend="indent">For you want to chum with us and words you lack; </l>

<p>MORE than all the others put together the war poems of Alan Seeger, Lieutenant Colonel McCrae, and Lieut. Rupert Brooke, have touched and thrilled the heart of America. They are quiet, earnest, yet more powerful than trumpet blasts, for they rise triumphant from great depths, and as they sing, exalt.</p>
<p>Most familiar is our own Alan Seeger's "I Have a Rendezvous with Death." He was studying in Paris when the war broke out. In the third week he enlisted in the Foreign Legion. Two arduous years later he was called on higher service. July 4, 1916, his squad was caught in an assault on the village of Belloy-en-Santerre, where the Germans received them with the fire of six machine guns. Seeger was severely wounded, but went forward with the others, and helped take the place. Next morning he died. He had kept the tryst.</p>

<p>Alan Seeger was a New York boy. He was born in that city June 22, 1888. In his short life he had written some twenty poems. This was his last. It was written in camp, shortly before his call came:</p>

<p>
Lieut. Col. John McCrae was a Canadian physician who served in the South African war as an artilleryman. He was on his way to Canada when the war began in 1914, and immediately upon landing he entered the Val Cartier training camp and was commissioned a Captain. Later he joined the McGill Hospital corps and went with it to France, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and died in service, January 28, 1918.</p>
<p>His poem, "In Flanders' Fields," was written on the Flanders front
in the Spring of 1915. Its inspiration is thus explained by Sergeant
Charles F. Bisset, of the 19th Battlion, 1st Brigade, Canadian
Infantry:</p><pb n="101"/>
<p>"On the Flanders front in the early Spring of 1915, when the war had settled down to trench fighting, two of the most noticeable features of the field were, first, the luxuriant growth of red poppies appearing among the graves of the fallen soldiers, and second, that only one species of bird--the larks--remained on the field during the fighting. As soon as the cannonading ceased, they would rise in the air, singing."</p></div>

<p>These songs, with others that have lilted so bravely, gravely,
through the world's most bitter years of travail, will live long in
literature, with many more as strong or as sweet. Had all the writers
lived, we would have had a wealth of splendid gifts from them,
especially, maybe, from that "poor bird--hearted singer of a day,"
Francis Ledwidge, who fell in battle in Flanders, July 31,
1917. Ledwidge was discovered by Lord Dunsany, himself a soldier-poet
and a patron of poets. He was lance corporal in Lord Dunsany's company
in the 5th Battalion of the Royal Inniskillen Fusileers. He wrote
quite touchingly to a friend shortly before the end, "I mean to do
something great if I am spared, but out here one may at any moment be
hurled out of life." There is no doubt he would have done "something
great," for here is a swan song not unworthy to bear his name to later
times:</p> </div>

<l n="1">DOWN the street, with a lilting swing, </l>
<l>Each so bright that never a thing </l>
<l>Seemed to harass, so proud were they</l>
<l>One leg gone, but their hearts were gay</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Clickety clack, went the crutches' tune.</l>
<l>God! How can they be brave so soon! </l>
<l>Brave, when I can not keep back the tears, </l>

<lg>
<l>With a rhythmic swing they passed me by, </l>
<l>And although, at first, I wanted to cry, </l>
<l>I didn't, because on each smiling face </l>
<l>Was the peace of God and the pride of race.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And the splendid pair, each with one leg gone, </l>
<l>Swung out of sight to the crutches' song. </l>
<l>And I thought I would give all my future joys </l>
<l>To feel just like those Canadian boys.</l></lg>

<l>All night long, like an ancient rune, </l>

<epigraph><q>At a pillaged hamlet near Termonde, I asked a dying peasant woman into which of the houses still standing should assist her--which was her home? She pressed a withered hand to her bayonet-pierced side and answered: "The Germans have taken one home from me; but, without knowing it, they have given me another.  I am going there now."</q></epigraph>

<l n="1">My house that I so soon shall own </l>

<l rend="indent">Before they burnt it overhead; </l>

<l rend="indent">Our daughter screaming in the red </l>
<l>Embrace of Uhlans at my door,</l>

<l>I shall not see the German hands</l>
<l rend="indent">That tear the baby from the breast; </l>

<l>Pink hollyhocks made friendly sport of me, </l>
<l>With nod and smile and endless courtesy </l>
<l>Enlive the lonely sameness of my way. </l>
<l>Slim little maids in rosy morning frocks </l>

<l>I like to think that somewhere, overseas, </l>

<l>Shy flowers from home lean out with wayward grace--</l>
<l>Blue iris and the valley lilies' lace--</l>
<l>Reminding them of happier times than these,...</l>

<l>The years go fast in Oxford, </l>
<l>The golden years and gay, </l>
<l>The hoary colleges look down </l>
<l>On careless boys at play. </l>
<l>But when the bugles sounded--War! </l>
<l>They put their games away.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They left the peaceful river, </l>
<l>The cricket field, the quad, </l>
<l>The shaven lawns of Oxford </l>
<l>To seek a bloody sod--</l>
<l>They gave their merry youth away </l>
<l>For country and for God.</l></lg>

<div id="Eaton103" type="essay" n="'Blighty' And 'Gone West'">
<head rend="center">"BLIGHTY" AND "GONE WEST"</head>
<p>BRITISH soldiers in France have developed a terminology that is plain to them, but confusing to civilians. They speak of "Blighty," for example, and of "Gone West." These two terms express hopes--Blighty meaning home; in common acceptance, home for rest and recuperation. "Gone West" means gone from the east with its conflict to the refuge of death, where peace waits in the glory of sunset.</p>
<div id="Eaton103a" type="poem introduction" n="Blighty">
<p>"Blighty" is of Hindu origin. British officers in South Africa who had served in India used the word, which is an Anglicized form of the Indian word "vilayti," meaning European. Englishmen being about the only Europeans the natives knew, its application narrowed down to England only; and the army fell into a way of using it as a synonym of home. When the troops from India came into action early in the war, their wounded were sent to the nearest English great hospital, at Brighton, just across the channel. The consonance of Brighton and vilayti or Blightv was so close that these men used their own word as a matter of course, and in this way it floated into general use.</p>
<p>It has acquired a new sense of late. Casualties intermediate to those too severe for removal and those that can he treated in field hospitals, are sent to Englandt--to Blighty--and are themselves called Blightv, meaning Wounds that get a man home. Lieut. Siegfried Sassoon has woven the idea into a plaintively whimsical bit of verse which he calls</p></div>

<l>He sighed, confused; then drew a cautious breath; </l>
<l>This level journeying was no ride through death.</l>
<l>"If I were dead," he mused, "there'd be no thinking--</l>
<l>Only some plunging underworld of sinking,</l>
<l>And hueless, shifting welter where I'd drown." </l>
<l>Then he remembered that his name was Brown.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>But was he back in Blighty? Slow he turned, </l>
<l>Till in his heart thanksgiving leaped and burned. </l>
<l>There shone the blue serene, the prosperous land, </l>
<l>Trees, cows and hedges; skipping these he scanned, </l>
<l>Large, friendly names that change net with the year, </l>
<l>Lung Tonic, Mustard, Liver Pills and Beer.</l></lg></div>
<div id="eaton104b" type="poem introduction" n="Going West"><ab><ptr target="Eaton104a"/></ab>
<p>Hugh Pendexter, in Adventure Magazine", says "going west," as used
by the men overseas to mean death, is of peculiarly American origin. The Karok Indians of California believed the spirit of the good Karok went to the "happy western land." The Cherokee myths picture the west as the "ghost country," the twilight land where go the dead. The Shawnee tell of the boy who traveled west" to find his sister in the spirit land. The Chippewa believes the spirit "followed a wide, beaten path toward the west."  The spirit world of the Fox Indians<pb n="123"/> is at the setting of the sun. And so on, in the theology of many Indian nations we find the West as the storied abode of the great majority--who have passed over.</p>

<p>The phrase traces back to the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles:
<q rend="center">Toward the Western shore<lb/>
Soul after soul is known to take her flight.</q>
Its later significance is tenderly sung by Eleanor Jewett in The Chicago Tribune</p></div>

<l>Straight and away into the sunset's glow, </l>
<l>Ribbed by the narrow barriers of Death--</l>
<l>Dark are the waters that beside it flow. </l>
<l>The red flowers fade upon the fields of France, </l>
<l>The soaring larks are fallen to their nest. </l>
<l>The glare of battle soothes a little space....</l>

<lg>
<l n="1">CLICK, click! how the needles go </l>
<l>Through the busy fingers, to and fro--</l>
<l>With no bright colors of berlin wool, </l>
<l>Delicate hands today are full: </l>
<l>Only a yarn of deep, dull blue, </l>
<l>Socks for the feet of the brave and true. </l>
<l>Yet click, click, how the needles go, </l>
<l>'Tis a power within that nerves them so. </l>
<l>In the sunny hours of the bright spring day, </l>
<l>And still in the night time far away. </l>
<l>Maiden, mother, grandame sit </l>
<l>Earnest and thoughtful while they knit.</l>
<l>Many the silent prayers they pray, </l>
<l>Many the tear drops brushed away. </l>
<l>While busy on the needles go, </l>
<l>Widen and narrow, heel and toe. </l>
<l>The grandame thinks with a thrill of pride</l>
<l>How her mother knit and spun beside </l>
<l>For that patriot band in olden days </l>
<l>Who died the Stars and Stripes to raise--</l>
<l>Now she in turn knits for the brave </l>
<l>Who'd die that glorious flag to save. </l>
<l>She is glad, she says, ''the boys" have gone, </l>
<l>'Tis just as their grandfathers would have done. </l>
<l>But she heaves a sigh and the tears will start, </l>
<l>For "the boys" were the pride of grandame's heart. </l>
<l>The mother's look is calm and high, </l>
<l>God only hears her soul's deep cry--</l>
<l>In Freedom's name, at Freedom's call, </l>
<l>She gave her sons--in them her all. </l>
<l>The maiden's cheek wears a paler shade.</l><pb n="129"/>
<l>But the light in her eyes is undismayed. </l>
<l>Faith and hope give strength to her sight, </l>
<l>She sees a red dawn after the night. </l>
<l>Oh, soldiers brave, will it brighten the day, </l>
<l>And shorten the march on the weary way, </l>
<l>To know that at home the loving and true </l>
<l>Are knitting and hoping and praying for your </l>
<l>Soft are the voices when speaking your name, </l>
<l>Proud are their glories when hearing your fame. </l>
<l>And the gladdest hour in their lives will be </l>
<l>When they greet you after the victory.

<l>Where the ranks are thickest-tearing </l>

<l n="1">ARCHDUKE FRANCIS FERDINAND, Austrian heir-apparent,</l>
<l>Rideth through the Shadow Land, not a lone knight errant,</l>
<l>But captain of a mighty train, millions upon millions,</l>
<l>Armies of the battle slain, hordes of dim civilians;</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>German ghosts who see their works with tortured eyes, the sorry</l>
<l>Spectres of sacred tyrants, Turks hunted by their quarry,</l>
<l>Liars, plotters red of hand--like waves of poisonous gases,</l>
<l>Sweeping through the Shadow Land the host of horror passes;</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Spirits bright as broken blades drawn for truth and honor,</l>
<l>Sons of Belgium, pallid maids, martyrs who have won her</l>
<l>Love eternal, bleeding breasts of the French defiance,</l>
<l>Russians on enraptured quests, Freedom's proud
alliance.</l></lg><pb n="138"/>
<lg>
<l>Through that hollow hush of doom, vast, unvisioned regions, </l>
<l>Led by Kitchener of Khartum, march the English legions:</l>
<l>Kilt and shamrock, maple leaf, dreaming Hindu faces,</l>
<l>Brows of glory, eyes of grief, arms of lost embraces.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Like a  moaning tide of woe, midst those pale battalions </l>
<l>From the Danube and the Po, Arabs and Australians, </l>
<l>Pours a ghastly multitude that breaks the heart of pity,</l>
<l>Wreckage of some shell-bestrewed waste that was a city;</l>
<l>Flocking from the murderous seas, from the famished lowland,</l>
<l>From the blazing villages of Serbia and Poland,</l>
<l>Woman phantoms, baby wraiths, trampled by war's blindness,</l>
<l>Horses, dogs, that put their faiths in human loving kindness. </l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Tamburlane, Napoleon, envious Alexander </l>
<l>Peer in wonder at the wan, tragical commander, </l>
<l>Archduke Francis Ferdinand--when shall his train be ended ?--</l>
<l>Of all the lords of Shadow Land most royally attended!

<lg>
<l n="1">I ENLISTED in the infantry last summer;</l>
<l rend="indent">I was greeted at the training camp with joy;</l>
<l>I had hardly gotten settled, when a sergeant</l>
<l rend="indent">Told me I was now the Company's errand boy.</l>
<l>Now, I knew I'd have to start in at the bottom,</l>
<l rend="indent">And acquire my army training bit by bit;</l>
<l>But to be assigned to duties quite so humble,</l>
<l rend="indent">Was humiliating, surely you'll admit.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>My first errand was a trip to Field Headquarters.</l>
<l rend="indent">It was raining and the mud was deep and thick,</l>
<l>I was ordered to seek out the Major General,</l>
<l rend="indent">And procure a requisition for a brick.</l>
<l>'Twas explained to me, before I left my Company,</l>
<l rend="indent">That our Captain suffered much with chilly feet,</l>
<l>And that bricks, when rightly heated, would correct this.</l>
<l rend="indent">What that Major General said, I'll not repeat.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>To our surly Regimental Quartermaster,</l>
<l rend="indent">I was sent to get the Company's Sunday hats,</l>
<l>And my Sergeant said, "to save myself some walking,"</l>
<l rend="indent">I could "also get the First Lieutenant's spats";</l>
<l>When I told that sour Quartermaster's seageant</l>
<l rend="indent">What it was I'd like to have for Company A,</l>
<l>Gosh he "bawled me out," said "Your ears should be longer, </l>
<l rend="indent">And your rations should be changed from beans to hay."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>For a thousand feet of skirmish line I hunted </l>
<l rend="indent">For a half a day, before I saw the joke;</l><pb n="142"/>
<l>Next they sent me for a left--hand canvas stretcher,</l>
<l rend="indent">To repair the Mess-hall windows, which were broke.</l>
<l>As the Company Street was slightly rough and bumpy,</l>
<l rend="indent">They dispatched me for a double-jointed plow;</l>
<l>And one breakfast-time they sent me to the Colonel,</l>
<l rend="indent">With a pail, to milk the Regimental cow.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Then one day the Sergeant said, "You've been promoted.</l>
<l rend="indent">You're now morning call-boy for the Regiment,</l>
<l>And each morning, bright and early, you will sprinkle</l>
<l rend="indent">Drops of water on each face, in every tent."</l>
<l>In  the morning I began my sprinkling duties,</l>
<l rend="indent">And had sprinkled in about one dozen tents,</l>
<l>When a bunch of fellows rushed me to the hydrant,</l>
<l rend="indent">Where they "soused" me good; since then I've had me some sense.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>As I look back at the time I "ran the paddles,"</l>
<l rend="indent">After having set me down in water wet;</l>
<l>Rushing down between two rows of husky messmates,</l>
<l rend="indent">With my arms above my head, I feel it yet.</l>
<l>Now, I've graduated from the rookie section,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the "awkward squad" will miss me in its ranks,</l>
<l>And I'm happy, for a hunch of bloomin' rookies</l>
<l rend="indent">Have arrived.  To those that sent them, Many Thanks.

<l n="1">I TRIED to be a doughboy, but they said my feet were flat</l>
<l>And I'd surely never stand the awful strain.</l>
<l>No chance to even argue that I'd like to bet my hat</l>
<l>I could out walk any tar--heel in the train.</l>
<l>"Awfull sorry, but it's useless," was the doctor's mournful wail.</l>
<l>"Your eyesight quite unfits you for the guns."</l>
<l>Uselessly I tried to tell him that at dropping leaden hail</l>
<l>I could surely decimate a pack of Huns.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then I hoped for aviation, for my nerve is still in place,</l>
<l>But there wasn't even half a chance for that.</l>
<l>A stocky young lieutenant said, "You'll never hold the pace,</l>
<l>For you've got a jumpy eyebrow." Think o' that!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>So they went and made me captain in the Quartermaster Corps,</l>
<l>Where I juggle lists of beans the livelong day.</l>
<l>Trying hard to grin and bear it as the boys march off to war</l>
<l>While I sit and figure up their blasted pay.

<l n="1">IT is portentous, and a thing of state,</l>
<l>That here at midnight, in our little town </l>
<l>A mourning figure walks, and will not rest, </l>
<l>Near the old court house pacing up and down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards </l>
<l>He lingers where his children used to play, </l>
<l>Or through the market, on the well-worn stones </l>
<l>He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black, </l>
<l>A famous high-top hat and plain worn shawl </l>
<l>Make him the quaint great figure that men love, </l>
<l>The prairie lawyer, master of us all.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>He cannot sleep upon his hillside now. </l>
<l>He is among us;-as in times before! </l>
<l>And we who toss and lie awake for long </l>
<l>Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door. </l></lg>

<lg>
<l>His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings. </l>
<l>Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep? </l>
<l>Too many peasants fight, they know not why, </l>
<l>Too many homesteads in black terror weep. </l></lg>
<lg>
<l>The sins of all the warlords burn his heart. </l>
<l>He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main. </l>
<l>He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now </l>
<l>The bitterness, the folly and the pain</l></lg><pb n="145"/>

<lg>
<l>He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn</l>
<l>Shall come;--the shining hope of Europe free;</l>
<l>The League of sober folk, the Workers' Earth</l>
<l>Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>It breaks his heart that kings must murder still, </l>
<l>That all his hours of travail here for men </l>
<l>Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace</l>
<l>That he may sleep upon his hill again?

<l n="1">OH ye whose hearts are resonant, and ring to W'ar's romance,</l>
<l>Hear ye the story of a boy, a peasant boy of France;</l>
<l>Alad uncouth and warped with toil, yet who, when trial came,</l>
<l>Could feel within his soul upleap and soar, the sacred flame;</l>
<l>Could stand upright, and scorn and smite, as only heroes may:</l>
<l>Oh, harken! Let me try to tell the tale of Jean Desprez.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>With fire and sword the Teuton horde was ravaging the land,</l>
<l>And there was darkness and despair, grim death on every hand;</l>
<l>Red fields of slaughter sloping down to ruin's black abyss;</l>
<l>The wolves of war ran evil-fanged, and little did they miss.</l>
<l>And on they came with fear and flame, to burn and loot and slay,</l>
<l>Until they reached the red--roofed croft, the home of Jean Desprez.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>"Rout out of the village, one and all!" the Uhlan Captain said.</l>
<l>"Behold! Some hand has fired a shot. My trumpeter is dead.</l><pb n="147"/>
<l>Now shall they Prussian vengeance know; now shall they rue the day,</l>
<l>For by this sacred German slain, ten of these dogs shall pay."</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>They drove the cowering peasants forth,. women and babes and men,</l>
<l>And from the last, with many a jeer, the Captain chose he ten;</l>
<l>Ten simple peasants, bowed with toil; they stood, they knew not why</l>
<l>Against the grey wall of the church, hearing their children cry;</l>
<l>Hearing their wives and mothers wail, with faces dazed they stood.</l>
<l>A moment only. . . . Ready! Fire! They weltered in their blood.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>But there was one who gazed unseen, who heard the frenzied cries,</l>
<l>Who saw these men in sabots fall before their children's eyes;</l>
<l>A Zouave wounded in a ditch, and knowing death was nigh,</l>
<l>He laughed with joy: "All! here is where I settle ere I die."</l>
<l>He clutched his rifle once again, and long he aimed and well. ..</l>
<l>A shot! Beside his victims ten the Uhlan Captain fell.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>They dragged the wounded Zouave out; their rage was like a flame.</l>
<l>With bayonets they pinned him down, until their Major came.</l>
<l>A blond, full-blooded man he was, and arrogant of eye.</l><pb n="148"/>
<l>He stared to see with shattered skull his favorite Captain lie.</l>
<l>"Nay, do not finish him so quick, this foreign swine," he cried;</l>
<l>Go nail him to the big church door: he shall be crucified."</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>With bayonets through hands and feet they nailed the Zouave there, </l>
<l>And there was anguish in his eyes, and horror in his stare;</l>
<l>"Water! A single drop!" he moaned; bat how they jeered at him, </l>
<l>And mocked him with an empty cup, and saw his sight grow dim;</l>
<l>And as in agony of death with blood his lips were wet,</l>
<l>The Prussian Major gaily laughed, and lit a cigarette.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>But 'mid the white--faced villagers who cowered in horror by, </l>
<l>Was one who saw the woeful sight, who heard the woeful cry:</l>
<l>"Water! One little drop, I beg! For love of Christ whodied.... "</l>
<l>It was the little Jean Desprez who turned and stole aside;</l>
<l>It was the little barefoot boy who came with cup abrim</l>
<l>And walked up to the dying roan, and gave the drink to him.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>A roar of rage! They seize the boy; they tear him fast away.</l>
<l>The Prussian Major swings around; no longer is he gay.</l>
<l>His teeth are wolfishly agleam; his face all dark with spite:</l>
<l>"Go shoot the brathe snarls," that dare defy our Prussian
might.</l><pb n="149"/>
<l>Yet stay! I have another thought. I'll kindly be, and spare.</l>
<l>Quick! give the lad a rifle charged, and set him squarely there,</l>
<l>And bid him shoot, and shoot to kill. Haste! Make him understand</l>
<l>The dying dog he fain would save shall perish by his hand.</l>
<l>And all his kindred they shall see, and all shall curse his name,</l>
<l>Who bought his life at such a cost, the price of death and shame."</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>They brought the boy, wild-eyed with fear; they made him understand;</l>
<l>They stood him by the dying man, a rifle in his hand.</l>
<l>"Make haste!" said they; "the time is short, and you must kill or die."</l>
<l>The Major puffed his cigarette, amusement in his eye.</l>
<l>And then the dying Zouave heard, and raised his weary head:</l>
<l>"Shoot, son, 'twill be the best for both; shoot swift and straight," he said.</l>
<l>"Fire first and last, and do not flinch; for lost to hope am I;</l>
<l>And I will murmur: Vive la France! and bless you ere I die."</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Half-blind with blows the boy stood there; he seemed to swoon and sway;</l>
<l>Then in that moment woke the soul of little Jean Desprez.</l>
<l>He saw the woods go sheening down: the larks were singing
clear;</l><pb n="150"/>
<l>And oh! the scents and sounds of spring, how sweet they were! how dear!</l>
<l>He felt the scent of new-mown hay, a soft breeze fanned his brow;</l>
<l>O God! the paths of peace and toil! How precious were they now!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>The summer days and summer ways, how bright with hope and bliss!</l>
<l>The autumn such a dream of gold; and all must end in this:</l>
<l>This shining rifle in his hand, that shambles all around;</l>
<l>The Zouave there with dying glare; the blood upon the ground;</l>
<l>The brutal faces round him ringed, the evil eyes aflame;</l>
<l>That Prussian bully standing by as if he watched a game.</l>
<l>"Make haste and shoot," the Major sneered; a minute more I give;</l>
<l>A minute more to kill your friend, if you yourself would live."</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>They only saw a barefoot boy, with blanched and twitching face;</l>
<l>They did not see within his eyes the glory of his race;</l>
<l>The glory of a million men who for fair France have died,</l>
<l>The splendor of self-sacrifice that will not be denied.</l>
<l>Yet he was but a peasant lad, and oh! but life was sweet.</l>
<l>"Your minute's nearly gone, my lad," he heard a voice repeat.</l>
<l>"Shoot! Shoot!" the dying Zouave moaned; "Shoot! Shoot!" the soldier said.</l>
<l>Then Jean Desprez reached out and shot . . . <hi rend="italic">the
Prussian Major dead!</hi></l></lg><pb n="151"/></div>

<l>Proudly, triumphantly. </l>
<l>Ever protectingly, </l>
<l>Flag of the free. </l>
<l>No foe our faith shall blight </l>

<l>Emblem of truth and right, </l>
<l>We bow to thee.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>As in grim days of yore</l>
<l>Now on a hostile shore, </l>
<l>Fulfill thy pledge once more, </l>
<l>Red, white and blue. </l>
<l>Long as thy stately bars </l>
<l>And heaven's reflected stars </l>
<l>Dishonor never mars, </l>
<l>We will be true.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Prove to the waiting world, </l>
<l>When free men are assailed, </l>
<l>Our standard is unfurled </l>
<l>For justice still. </l>
<l>Strengthen us lest we fall, </l>
<l>Inspiring one and all, </l>
<l>Urging thy righteous call, </l>

<note place="inline">In this piece of work Mr. Runyon presents a good specimen of a large class, a young fellow who was going the trifling way to the Everlasting Bonfire when the war caught him up and made a man of him, Thousands of such cases, before the war little better than waste human material, went out to fight, and found themselves, and made good, and came home sobered, serious men, worthy to stand among those to whom the nation's destinies were confided.</note>

<l n="1">SON o' ol' Miz McAuliffe, the widder o' Box-Car Jack,</l>
<l>An' ol' time shack on the Santa Fe, who run to Dodge and back.</l>
<l>He was killed in a wreck at La Junta, and he left the wife and boy--</l>
<l>A kid knee--high to a hop--toad, and tagged by the name o' Roy.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>This Roy was sort o' onery, and he never would go to school.</l>
<l>He spent the most o' childhood days in learnin' the game o' pool.</l>
<l>His shoulders grew somewhat rounded, and his chest it grew rather thin--</l>
<l>But, gosh, he grew to a marvel at knockin' them pool balls in!</l></lg>
<lg><pb n="156"/>
<l>Pool-shootin' Roy, we called him, and many a night I've set </l>
<l>Watchin' him clean the table, and puffin' his cigaret. </l>
<l>Sleeves rolled up to the elbow, and plavin' so ca'm and cool</l>
<l>If ever a lad was born for a thing, he was born for playin' this pool!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Fifteen balls was a cinch for him--fifteen balls from the break; </l>
<l>One ball loose from the bunch a bit, and the whole darned rack he'd take.</l>
<l>He was great on a combination, and great on a cut-shot, too--</l>
<l>He'd make those pool balls talk to him when he started handlin' a cue!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>And some of us thought he'd be champeen, but every one didn't agree,</l>
<l>For Doctor Wilcox wanted to bet he'd die of the old T. B.</l>
<l>But the war it settled the question, for the first of our kids to go</l>
<l>Was Pool-Shootin' Roy McAuliffe--our poolrooms suffered a blow.</l></lg>
<lg rend="italic">
<l>What is that thing the Frenchmen give to a good game fightin' boy?</l>
<l>Say it again--the Croix de Guerre? Well, that's what they give to Roy.</l>
<l>It seems fifteen Germans were on him, and handlin' him rather mean,</l>
<l>When he got a machine gun to workin' and pocketed the whole fifteen!

<l n="1">SAY, Pa! What is a service flag? </l>
<l rend="indent">I see them everywhere.</l>
<l>There's little stars sewed on them;</l>
<l rend="indent">What are they doing there?</l>
<l>Sometimes there's lots of little stars,</l>

<l>My darling boy, those little stars</l>
<l rend="indent">Upon a field of white,</l>
<l>Are emblems of our glorious boys</l>

<note place="inline">POEMS need not be rhymed, nor wrought in verses.  This brave and touching one occurred in a letter written by a French schoolgirl:</note>
<lg>
<l n="1">"It was only a little river; almost a brook; it was called the Yser. One could talk from one side to the other without raising one's voice, and the birds could fly over it with one sweep of their wings. And on the two banks there were millions of men, the one toward the other, eye to eye. But the distance which separated them was greater than the stars in the sky; it was the distance which separates right from injustice.</l></lg>
<lg><l>"The ocean is so vast that the sea gulls do not dare to cross
it. During seven days and seven nights the great steamships of
America, going at full speed, drive through the deep waters before the
lighthouses of France come into view; but from one side to the other,
hearts are touching."</l></lg></div><pb n="160"/>

<l>One was a widow (listen to the guns!)--</l>

<l>And the bending cottonwoods touch the willows, </l>

<l>And the mill wheels hum at the break of morn; </l>
<l>Hills where the clover is newly shorn; </l>
<l>And sharply pungent as old-world gorse is </l>
<l>The hay that the wagons have hurried home; </l>
<l>And under the steady feet of the horses </l>
<l>The furrows grow in the loose black loam. </l>
<l>And ever the amber tassels seize </l>
<l>The wings of every riotous breeze </l>
<l>To fling gonfalons of golden sleaze, </l>
<l>Silken and soft, to the earth's far borders: </l>
<l>"August heat but hastens the days </l>
<l>When the hungry herds and the empty larders </l>

<l>Long, long leagues from a land o'erseas; </l>
<l>Empty hands that can know no sowing, </l>
<l>Passionate pleading hands are these--</l>
<l>Palms outstretched to us over the seas; </l>
<l>Ah, the heart of France is a thing to cherish! </l>
<l>But her werewolf, Hunger, cannot be slain </l>
<l>Till out of our largess, lest she perish, </l>
<l>We hasten the caravels of blessed grain.</l><pb n="165"/>

<l>Here they have written with their ebbing blood the slogan that has thrilled the world--"They shall not pass!"</l>
<l rend="indent">The gaunt and sinister craters, one merging into the ragged rim of
another, the bits of shell, the battered hel<pb n="168"/>mets, broken guns,
ill-assorted refuse of combat--each shattered particle a marker for
some valiant soul "gone west" in service of humanity.</l>
<l>Here, over this land glorified by a nobility of deed than which
there has been no more exalted, must our war be waged. Out of this
hallowed ground comes the call of those who have given of their
best--the call to our great land for Old Glory's best!</l>
<l rend="indent">There will come to us wounds that will rack our bodies and drain
the coursing blood of our vibrant veins. There will come to us the
aching pain of suffering and loss--here on these red fields of
France. But we will save our souls and our nation's soul! And we will
save our heritage and give to the billions of the world the right to theirs.</l>
<l rend="indent">So the brown ribbon of youth winds across the sea--to Verdun and
to the long, thin lines on either side. Here will we prove our right to life and liberty!</l>
<l rend="indent">Brown ribbon of promise!</l>
<l rend="indent">Hoping, longing, wounded France!</l>
<l rend="indent">Brown ribbon of youth and high resolve!</l>
<l rend="indent">Brown ribbon of Liberty!</l>
<l rend="indent">Here at Verdun!

<lg>
<l n="1">THERE used to be a boy next door</l>
<l rend="indent">Whom I often have longed to throttle;</l>
<l>I've wished a thousand times and more</l>
<l rend="indent">That he had died while "on the bottle"! </l>
<l>Oft in the past it has been hard </l>
<l rend="indent">For me to check my inclination, </l>
<l>When he had cluttered up our yard,</l>
<l rend="indent">To hand him heavy castigation.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>With freckles on his tilted nose</l>
<l rend="indent">And ears that far in space protruded,</l>
<l>He was not one, as heaven knows,</l>
<l rend="indent">To whom I in my prayers alluded.</l>
<l>Derisively he showed his tongue</l>
<l rend="indent">And scorned the warnings which I gave him, </l>
<l>But now I list myself among</l>
<l rend="indent">The ones who pray the Lord to save him.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>How vividly I can recall</l>
<l rend="indent">Him at the window, making faces;</l>
<l>I used to think that in him all</l>
<l rend="indent">The impish traits had lurking places.</l>
<l>He stole the green fruit from my trees,</l>
<l rend="indent">Not caring how it might affect him;</l>
<l>Today he's fighting overseas,</l>
<l rend="indent">And may the God of hosts protect him!</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>From childhood into youth he passed,</l>
<l rend="indent">And then my little garden flourished;</l>
<l>And still his friendship was not classed</l>
<l rend="indent">Among the treasures which I nourished.</l>
<l>He tortured first a slide tombone,</l><pb n="173"/>
<l rend="indent">And next he tried a squeaky fiddle;</l>
<l>His voice took on a raucous tone</l>
<l rend="indent">That used to rasp me down the middle.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>How soldierly our lad appeared</l>
<l rend="indent">When with his comrades he departed!</l>
<l>I wonder if he knew I cheered,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or guessed that I was heavy--hearted.</l>
<l>If I have damned him heretofore</l>
<l rend="indent">I now retract each foul aspersion</l>
<l>God bless the boy who lived next door,</l>
<l rend="indent">And used to be my pet aversion!</l></lg></div>

<l n="1">OH, Carranza sent a cable- (on the kaiser's birthday) gram</l>

<l>And it said, "Look out for uncle(that's my northern neighbor) Sam,</l>
<l>For he's coming after you!"</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then the Kaiser waved his iron (as the papers have it) hand,</l>
<l>And he danced a little sar- (that's a Turkish tango) band</l>

<l>THE outfield is a--creepin in to catch the kaiser's pop,</l>

<l>He's tossed the horsehide far away to plug the hand-grenade;</l>

<l>He'll last through extra innings and he'll hit as well as pitch;</l>
<l>His smoking Texas leaguers'll make the Fritzies seek the ditch!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>He's just about to groove it toward a ducking Fritzie's bean</l>
<l>His crossfire is the puzzlingest that ever yet was seen;</l>
<l>His spittle is a deadly thing; his little inshoot curve</l>
<l>Will graze some Heinie's heaving ribs and make him lose his nerve.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Up in the air he never goes; he always cuts the plate,</l>
<l>No matter if the bleachers rise and start "the Hymn of Hate;"</l>
<l>And pacifistic coaching never once has got his goat.</l>
<l>Just watch him heave across the top the latest Yankee note!</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>The Boches claim the Umpire is a-sidin' with their nine,</l>
<l>But we are not the boobs to fall for such a phony line;</l>
<l>We know the game is fair and square, decisions on the level</l>

Devil!</l></lg><pb n="178"/>
<lg>
<l>The series now is opened, and the band begins to play; </l>
<l>The batteries are warming up; the crowd shouts, "Hip-Hurray!" </l>
<l>The catcher is a-wingin' 'em to second, third and first, </l>
<l>And if a Heinie tries to steal, he's sure to get the worst.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>So watch the southpaw twirler in his uniform O. D. </l>
<l>Retire to the players' bench the Boches--one, two, three! </l>
<l>He'll never walk a bloomin' one, nor let 'em hit it out.</l>
<l> Just watch him make 'em fan the air and put the Hun to rout!

<l n="1">THE mist hangs low and quiet on a ragged line of hills,</l>
<l rend="indent">There's a whispering of wind across the flat;</l>
<l>You'd be feeling kind of lonesome if it wasn't for one thing--</l>
<l rend="indent">The patter of the raindrops on your old tin hat.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>An' you just can't help a-figuring--sitting here alone--</l>
<l rend="indent">About this war and hero stuff and that,</l>
<l>And you wonder if they haven't sort of got things twisted up,</l>
<l rend="indent">While the rain keeps up its patter on your old tin hat.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>When you step off with the outfit to do your little bit,</l>
<l rend="indent">You're simply doing what you're s'posed to do--</l>
<l>And you don't take time to figure what you gain or what you lose,</l>
<l rend="indent">It's the spirit of the game that brings you through.</l></lg><pb n="183"/>
<lg>
<l>But back at home she's waiting, writing cheerful little notes,</l>
<l rend="indent">And every night she offers up a prayer </l>
<l>And just keeps on a-hoping that her soldier boy is safe--</l>
<l rend="indent">The mother of the boy who's over there.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And, fellows, she's the hero of this great big ugly war,</l>
<l rend="indent">And her prayer is on that wind across the flat;</l>
<l>And don't you reckon maybe it's her tears, and not the rain,</l>
<l rend="indent">That's keeping up the patter on your old tin hat?

<note place="inline">Grief for a brother, an American who was killed in France, brought about the suicide of the author of this poem.  The manuscript was found beside his body.  The lines were published in THE CHICAGE TRIBUNE</note>
<lg>
<l n="1">HIS regiment came home today,</l>
<l>But Jim, old Jim, he's still away. </l>
<l>I know, I know, he's sleeping there </l>
<l>Out on the fields of France somewhere. </l>
<l>And yet, I stood out in the rain, </l>
<l>To watch the boys come home again, </l>
<l>Just wishing that it wasn't true, </l>
<l>And that Jim would be coming, too. </l>
<l>Yet, all the while, I knew, I knew--</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Old Jim, he's gone. They tell me how </l>
<l>He fell against the Huns, and now, </l>
<l>He's gained a sort of dignity </l>
<l>That somehow seems could never be; </l>
<l>For Jim, he was so gay and free, </l>
<l>With never a thought of greater weight </l>
<l>Than just to keep an evening date, </l>
<l>Or get some cigarets, perhaps, </l>
<l>Or shoot a game or two of craps, </l>
<l>Or dance all night, then drive all day </l>
<l>His roadster down the speeding way. </l>
<l>But, now, Jim's gone, the folks will say, </l>
<l>He was a wonder in his day. </l>
<l>Old Jim--he wasn't old, you know--</l>
<l>I say that for I love him so--</l>
<l>Grew up with me, and he and I </l>
<l>Would never let a day go by </l>
<l>That I did not see some plan begun </l>
<l>In which we both would have some fun.</l></lg><pb n="193"/>

<lg>
<l>And then, there comes that fateful day, </l>
<l>When our men go to join the fray; </l>
<l>And Jim can go, but I must stay. </l>
<l>"Good-by, old top, if I'm not dead, </l>
<l>I'll give the Kaiser hell," he said. </l>
<l>I think he meant it, but--. Oh, well, </l>
<l>He didn't give the Kaiser hell.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Folks always said that Jim was light, </l>
<l>And stayed out much too late at night, </l>
<l>Frivolous and never would, </l>
<l>Whatever else he did, make good.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Why, no one ever thought to take </l>
<l>Jim seriously, the reckless rake! </l>
<l>But when the time to charge had come, </l>
<l>Jim left the trench, along with some </l>
<l>More daring chaps, and crawling, spanned </l>
<l>The hell that they call "No Man's Land."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They cut the tangled wires away, </l>
<l>Then our men charged, but there Jim lay--</l>
<l>What is it that the Scriptures say </l>
<l>About the chap that offers up </l>
<l>His all, and drinks the bitter cup--</l>
<l>That's how I like to think of Jim, </l>
<l>The glory that is left of him.

<l>God's love and mercy guard them all.

<l n="1">B LACK with the blackness of hell and despair </l>
<l>Village and village and village lay there; </l>
<l>Never a candle and never a lamp--</l>
<l>Four hundred miles of the enemies' camp.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Trains of munitions that creak with their loads, </l>
<l>Supplies, horses, soldiers engulfed by the roads; </l>
<l>An ambulance crawling, a password, and then </l>
<l>Through the shell-shattered houses the marching of men.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Black with the blackness of wounds and of death </l>
<l>The villages huddled there holding their breath; </l>
<l>Black--till there rang this new order to "Cease"--</l>
<l>"It is over!--all over!--the war!--<hi rend="italic">there is peace!</hi></l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Come, dance on the ruins--Look, No Man's Land there, </l>
<l>"Verboten" for years, is a world's thoroughfare; </l>
<l>And village and village, remember the night, </l>
<l>But turn it to day--and let there be light.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>The sorrow unburied, destruction--how much! </l>
<l>Four hundred long miles for the taper to touch! </l>
<l>The shades are undrawn, the lamps shining bright; </l>
<l>It is dawn in the darkness; again There Is Light!

<lg>
<l n="1">OUT in that vague, vast "somewhere" of The Line </l>
<l>They killed Old Jim, a proven friend of mine. </l>
<l>Killed him at night, while he was on patrol; </l>
<l>All the company found was just a hole </l>
<l>A damned boche shell had dug out where he'd gone. </l>
<l>The outfit passed the place just after dawn </l>
<l>And saw some bodies; but they couldn't tell </l>
<l>Which one was which. They all were smashed to hell! </l>
<l>They put Jim on the list, "Reported Dead"; </l>
<l>"Missing in Action," the home papers said. </l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I wasn't in The Line when Jim went out. </l>
<l>A piece of shrapnel had hit me a clout </l>
<l>Which kept me pretty quiet for a while--</l>
<l>Gray days when it was mighty hard to smile. </l>
<l>And when I learned Old Jim had topped the ridge </l>
<l>I fell to thinking what a privilege </l>
<l>It was to know him. Jim was just the kind </l>
<l>That stops to pet a dog or help the blind. </l>
<l>The sort you turn to when things don't go right, </l>
<l>And then forget when all the world is bright. </l>
<l>Jim had a kindly eye that seemed to see </l>
<l>The best in men. What could he see in me? </l>
<l>I never knew; but Jim was always glad </l>
<l>To give me half of everything he had. </l>
<l>That's why, you see, it cut me mighty deep </l>
<l>To know Old Jim was Out There--in a heap. </l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I've said Old Jim was not identified. </l>
<l>All the outfit ever knew was--he died! </l>
<l>And though there is no way to prove it's so </l>
<l>This Unknown Soldier is Old Jim. I know! </l>
<l>The Congress Medal and the D. S. C., </l>
<l>Have been given this Lost Identity; </l>
<l>And knowing that they both were earned by him, </l>
<l>I know the Unknown Soldier is--Old Jim!

<l n="1">THE wind to-day is full of ghosts with ghostly bugles blowing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Where shadows steal across the world, as silent as the dew.</l>
<l>Where golden youth is yellow dust, by haunted rivers flowing</l>
<l>Through valleys where the crosses grow, as harvest wheat is growing,</l>
<l rend="indent">And only dead men see the line that passes in review.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>The gripping clay once more gives way before the Mighty Mother</l>
<l rend="indent">Who waits with everlasting arms to guard her sleeping sons.</l>
<l>And lonely mates in silent fields call out to one another </l>
<l>The story of an empty grave, where each has lost a brother,</l>
<l rend="indent">Who takes the long, long trail at last beyond the rusting guns.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Gently the east wind brought him home to meet the south wind sighing.</l>
<l rend="indent">Softly the north wind breathes his name that none of us may know.</l>
<l>For only those who fell with him, out in the darkness lying,</l>
<l>Can tell his company or rank, and they are unreplying,</l>
<l rend="indent">As each dreams on through summer dawns or winter's mantling
snow.</l></lg><pb n="201"/>
<lg>
<l>Nameless--and yet how gallantly he faced the roaring thunder</l>
<l rend="indent">Where names were less than star-dust as the crashing steel swept by</l>
<l>To take its endless toll of those the night squad spaded under,</l>
<l>Clod upon clod, beneath the sod that time alone may sunder,</l>
<l rend="indent">Held where the wind--blown grasses stir beneath an alien sky.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>He'll miss, perhaps, the poppy blooms that sway above the clover,</l>
<l rend="indent">But rose-red wreaths of Arlington bend low above his dreams.</l>
<l>The reveille at dawn is done, the slogging hikes are over,</l>
<l>Where out the friendly lanes of home, a gay and careless rover,</l>
<l rend="indent">His wild, free spirit seeks the hills and haunts the singing streams.</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>No more he moves by Meuse or Aisne, some shell-swept river wading,</l>
<l rend="indent">No marching orders call him from his rough-hewn granite grave. </l>
<l>And when at dusk we hear far off the eerie drum-taps fading, </l>
<l>What hallowed spot holds more than this, with spectral lines parading </l>
<l rend="indent">Blood of our blood, dust of our dust, "the ashes of our brave''?</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>There will be tears from watching eyes, where rain and mist are blended, </l>
<l rend="indent">There will be heartache in the lines where gold-starred mothers
wait.</l><pb n="202"/>
<l>But where the great shells fall no more, what vision is more splendid</l>
<l>Than peace along the once--scarred fields, the last red battle ended,</l>
<l rend="indent">Peace that he helped to bring again above the twilight gate?</l></lg>
<lg>
<l>Let valor's minstrel voices sing his fame for future pages,</l>
<l rend="indent">But when the starless darkness comes and the long silence creeps,</l>
<l>When blossom mists of spring return or winter torrent rages,</l>
<l>Write this above his nameless dust, to last beyond the 
ages, </l>
<l rend="indent">"Safe in the Mighty Mother's arms an Unknown Soldier sleeps."
