<l n="1">O<hi rend="smallcaps">ver</hi> the twilight field,</l>
<l>Over the glimmering field</l>
<l>And bleeding furrows, with their sodden yield</l>
<l>Of sheaves that still did writhe,</l>
<l>After the scythe;</l>
<l>The teeming field, and darkly overstrewn</l>
<l>With all the garnered fullness of that noon --</l>
<l>Two looked upon each other.</l>
<l>One was a Woman, men had called their mother:</l>
<l>And one the Harvest Moon.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And one the Harvest Moon</l>
<l>Who stood, who gazed</l>
<l>On those unquiet gleanings, where they bled;</l>
<l>Till the lone Woman said:</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"But we were crazed...</l>
<l>We should laugh now together, I and you;</l>
<l>We two.</l>
<l>You, for your ever dreaming it was worth</l>
<l>A star's while to look on, and light the earth;</l>
<l>And I, for ever telling to my mind</l>
<l>Glory it was and gladness, to give birth</l>
<l>To human kind.</l>
<l>I gave the breath, -- and thought it not amiss,</l>
<l>I gave the breath to men,</l>
<l>For men to slay again;</l>
<l>Lording it over anguish, all to give</l>
<l>My life, that men might live,</l>
<l>For this.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="244"/>
<l>"You will be laughing now, remembering</l>
<l>We called you once Dead World, and barren thing.</l>
<l>Yes, so we called you then,</l>
<l>You, far more wise</l>
<l>Than to give life to men."</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Over the field that there</l>
<l>Gave back the skies</l>
<l>A scattered upward stare</l>
<l>From sightless eyes,</l>
<l>The furrowed field that lay</l>
<l>Striving awhile, through many a bleeding dune</l>
<l>Of throbbing clay, -- but dumb and quiet soon,</l>
<l>She looked; and went her way,</l>
<l>The Harvest Moon.</l></lg>

<l n="1">M<hi rend="smallcaps">oon</hi>, slow rising, over the trembling sea-rim,</l>
<l>Moon of the lifted tides and their folded burden,</l>
<l>Look, look down. And gather the blinded oceans.</l>
<l>Moon of compassion.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Come, white Silence, over the one sea pathway:</l>
<l>Pour with hallowing hands on the surge and outcry,</l>
<l>Silver flame; and over the famished blackness,</l>
<l>Petals of moonlight.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Once again, the formless void of a world-wreck</l>
<l>Gropes its way through the echoing dark of chaos:</l>
<l>Tide on tide, to the calling, lost horizons, --</l>
<l>One in the darkness.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="245"/>
<l>You that veil the light of the all-beholding,</l>
<l>Shed white tidings down to the dooms of longing,</l>
<l>Down to the timeless dark; and the sunken treasures,</l>
<l>One in the darkness.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Touch, and harken, -- under that shrouding silver,</l>
<l>Rise and fall, the heart of the sea and its legions,</l>
<l>All and one; one with the breath of the deathless,</l>
<l>Rising and falling.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Touch and waken so, to a far hereafter,</l>
<l>Ebb and flow, the deep, and the dead in their longing:</l>
<l>Till at last, on the hungering face of the waters,</l>
<l>There shall be Light.</l></lg>

<l n="1">H<hi rend="smallcaps">ere</hi> is his little cambric frock</l>
<l>That I laid by in lavender so sweet,</l>
<l>And here his tiny shoe and sock</l>
<l>I made with loving care for his dear feet.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I fold the frock across my breast,</l>
<l>And in imagination, ah, my sweet,</l>
<l>Once more I hush my babe to rest,</l>
<l>And once again I warm those little feet.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="246"/>
<l>Where do those strong young feet now stand?</l>
<l>In flooded trench, half numb to cold or pain,</l>
<l>Or marching through the desert sand</l>
<l>To some dread place that they may never gain.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>God guide him and his men to-day!</l>
<l>Though death may lurk in any tree or hill,</l>
<l>His brave young spirit is their stay,</l>
<l>Trusting in that they'll follow where he will.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They love him for his tender heart</l>
<l>When poverty or sorrow asks his aid,</l>
<l>But he must see each do his part --</l>
<l>Of cowardice alone he is afraid.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I ask no honours on the field,</l>
<l>That other men have won as brave as he --</l>
<l>I only pray that God may shield</l>
<l>My son, and bring him safely back to me!</l></lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l n="1">I <hi rend="smallcaps">went</hi> upon a journey</l>
<l>To countries far away,</l>
<l>From province unto province</l>
<l>To pass my holiday.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And when I came to Serbia,</l>
<l>In a quiet little town</l>
<l>At an inn with a flower-filled garden</l>
<l>With a soldier I sat down.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="248"/>
<l>Now he lies dead at Belgrade.</l>
<l>You heard the cannon roar!</l>
<l>It boomed from Rome to Stockholm,</l>
<l>It pealed to the far west shore.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And when I came to Russia,</l>
<l>A man with flowing hair</l>
<l>Called me his friend and showed me</l>
<l>A flowing river there.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now he lies dead at Lemberg,</l>
<l>Beside another stream,</l>
<l>In his dark eyes extinguished</l>
<l>The friendship of his dream.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And then I crossed two countries</l>
<l>Whose names on my lips are sealed...</l>
<l>Not yet had they flung their challenge</l>
<l>Nor led upon the field</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Sons who lie dead at Li&egrave;ge,</l>
<l>Dead by the Russian lance,</l>
<l>Dead in southern mountains,</l>
<l>Dead through the farms of France.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I stopped in the land of Louvain,</l>
<l>So tranquil, happy, then.</l>
<l>I lived with a good old woman,</l>
<l>With her sons and her grandchildren.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now they lie dead at Louvain,</l>
<l>Those simple kindly folk.</l>
<l>Some heard, some fled. It must be</l>
<l>Some slept, for they never woke.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="249"/>
<l>I came to France. I was thirsty.</l>
<l>I sat me down to dine.</l>
<l>The host and his young wife served me</l>
<l>With bread and fruit and wine.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now he lies dead at Cambrai --</l>
<l>He was sent among the first.</l>
<l>In dreams she sees him dying</l>
<l>Of wounds, of heat, of thirst.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>At last I passed to Dover</l>
<l>And saw upon the shore</l>
<l>A tall young English captain</l>
<l>And soldiers, many more.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Now they lie dead at Dixmude,</l>
<l>The brave, the strong, the young!</l>
<l>I turn unto my homeland,</l>
<l>All my journey sung!</l></lg>
