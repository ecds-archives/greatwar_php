DIES IRAE
$$TO THE GERMAN KAISER

Amazing Monarch! who at various times,
<l rend="indent">Posing as Europe's self-appointed saviour,
Afforded copy for our ribald rhymes
<l rend="indent10">By your behaviour;

We nursed no malice; nay, we thanked you much
<l rend="indent">Because your head-piece, swollen like a tumour,
Lent to a dullish world the needed touch
<l rend="indent10">Of saving humour.

What with your wardrobes stuffed with warrior gear,
<l rend="indent">Your gander-step parades, your prancing Prussians,
Your menaces that shocked the deafened sphere
<l rend="indent10">With rude concussions;

Your fist that turned the pinkest rivals pale
<l rend="indent">Alike with sceptre, chisel, pen or palette,
And could at any moment, gloved in mail,
<l rend="indent10">Smite like a mallet; 

<pb n="69"/>
Master of all the Arts, and, what was more,
<l rend="indent">Lord of the limelight blaze that let us know it --
You seemed a gift designed on purpose for
<l rend="indent10">The flippant poet.

Time passed and put to these old jests an end;
<l rend="indent">Into our open hearts you found admission,
Ate of our bread and pledged us like a friend
<l rend="indent10">Above suspicion.

You shared our griefs with seeming-gentle eyes;
<l rend="indent">You moved among us cousinly entreated;
Still hiding, under that fair outward guise,
<l rend="indent10">A heart that cheated.

And now the mask is down, and forth you stand
<l rend="indent">Known for a King whose word is no great matter,
A traitor proved, for every honest hand
<l rend="indent10">To strike and shatter.

This was the "Day" foretold by yours and you
<l rend="indent">In whispers here, and there with beery clamours --
You and your rat-hole spies and blustering crew
<l rend="indent10">Of loud Potsdamers.

<pb n="70"/>
And lo, there dawns another, swift and stern,
<l rend="indent">When on the wheels of wrath, by Justice' token,
Breaker of God's own Peace, you shall in turn
<l rend="indent10">Yourself be broken.

TO WOMEN

Your hearts are lifted up, your hearts
That have foreknown the utter price,
Your hearts burn upward as a flame
Of splendour and of sacrifice.

For you, you too to battle go,
Not with the marching drums and cheers,
But in the watch of solitude
And through the boundless night of fears.

Swift, swifter than those hawks of war,
Those threatening wings that pulse the air,
Far as the vanward ranks are set,
You are gone before them, you are there!

And not a shot comes blind with death,
And not a stab of steel is pressed
Home, but invisibly it tore
And entered first a woman's breast.

<pb n="72"/>
Amid the thunder of the guns,
The lightning of the lance and sword,
Your hope, your dread, your throbbing pride,
Your infinite passion is outpoured

From hearts that are as one high heart
Withholding naught from doom and bale,
Burningly offered up -- to bleed,
To bear, to break, but not to fail.

TOWARDS THE LIGHT

Once o'er those downs wild beacons blazed,
<l rend="indent">Weird messengers of fate and fight,
<hi rend="italic">She</hi> was not wild, dismayed, or dazed,
<l rend="indent">But calmly looked towards the light --
Towards the light that springs from night,
<l rend="indent">As sure as courage springs from faith.
So now, when like some hideous wraith
<l rend="indent">War mocks, with bodings from the dead,
Our moonlit harvests, swathe on swathe,
<l rend="indent">May she, dear England, lift her head
<l rend="indent4">Towards the light, towards the light --
<l rend="indent4">Praying that God defend the right.

ROLL UP!

"Roll up the map of Europe!"
<l rend="indent">The German Kaiser cried,
"For I'm the new Napoleon,
<l rend="indent">An' England's 'ands are tied."
But another sort o' rollin' up
<l rend="indent">Is comin' into play --
<l rend="italic">"Roll up! Roll up!" sez Kitchener,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">An' we're rollin' up all day.</hi>

'E thought, did Kaiser William,
<l rend="indent">That England would stand by,
While 'e an' 'is five million
<l rend="indent">Were crushin' 'er ally.
"For they 'aven't got the men," 'e said,
<l rend="indent">"To fight acrost the seas."
<l rend="italic">"Roll up! Roll up!" sez Kitchener,
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">"New Army, forward, please!"</hi>

<pb n="75"/>
Yes, 'e wants a Second Army --
<l rend="indent">'E's goin' to get it, too;
For we know the man that calls us,
<l rend="indent">An' we trust 'im thro' and thro'.
If K. should need a million men,
<l rend="indent">'E's only got to say --
<l rend="italic">"Roll up for King and Country!"
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">An' they'll roll up right away.</hi>

An' while we do our part 'ere,
<l rend="indent">We'll think with love an' pride
Of our comrades now a-rallyin'
<l rend="indent">Acrost the oceans wide.
For East an' West an' furthest South
<l rend="indent">They hear K.'s call resound --
<l rend="italic">"Roll up! Roll up for England!"
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">An' they're rollin' up all round.</hi>

UNTITLED

Not for passion or for power,
<l rend="indent">Clean of hands, and calm of soul,
England at this awful hour
<l rend="indent">Bids her battle-thunders roll,

That crown'd arrogance may quail
<l rend="indent">And brute-force be backward hurled --
Lest the hypocrite prevail,
<l rend="indent">Lest a lie should win the world;

Lest she see the trustful weak
<l rend="indent">Trampled by the perjured strong --
That her arm may help to wreak
<l rend="indent">Justice on red-handed wrong,

Till the hierophants of fear
<l rend="indent">Cease, beneath the darkened sun,
To boom out in Europe's ear
<l rend="indent">The grim gospel of the gun.

<pb n="77"/>
So, to meet yon myriad host
<l rend="indent">As we muster, land by land,
Witness Heaven -- no braggart boast --
<l rend="indent">That for righteousness we stand!

In the dread impending hour
<l rend="indent">Heedful of that warning word,
"'Not by might, and not by power --
<l rend="indent">By my Spirit,' saith the Lord."

TO THE BRITISH ARMY

British soldiers, once again
Ye are marshalled on the plain
By our fathers' blood renowned;
Ye are treading sacred ground!
Hearken, hearken as ye pass
To the voices in the grass!
On the Belgian soil it waves
O'er the lone, unnumbered graves
Where immortal warriors lie,
Devotees of Liberty,
Nobly fallen in the fray.
Ramillies and Malplaquet,
Quatre Bras and Waterloo
Yield their legions up to you!

British soldiers, ye will fight
'Neath the banner of the Right:
Ye are holding in your hands
Liberty of little lands,
<pb n="79"/>
Seeking nothing, giving all,
Answering to Honour's call,
Stay Aggression's grim attack!
Hurl the impious menace back!
Devotees of Liberty,
Ride ye now to victory!
We in England watch and pray: --
Ramillies and Malplaquet,
Quatre Bras and Waterloo
Yield their soul to strengthen you!

REDEMPTION

As though Youth had not all the best, this day
<l rend="indent">Offers him one excelling best-of-all, --
<l rend="indent">The glorious summons of a trumpet-call
To prove his manhood in man's noblest fray;
To be with those who fight at last to slay
<l rend="indent">That ancient despot, War. Whate'er befall,
<l rend="indent">His is a prize so rich as to forestall
The invidious years and venom of decay.
No fruitless age shall he regret who pays
<l rend="indent">Thus timely his arrears to Motherland
<l rend="indent">And humankind, ensuing Earth's desire;
Who stakes his else immemorable days
<l rend="indent">And wins his life back, holy from Death's hand,
<l rend="indent">Redeemed in one brief ecstasy of fire!

A BATTLE-SONG

Sons of Britain, old in fame,
Heirs of an immortal name,
Strike, because the danger's near,
Strike for all ye hold most dear;
Plunged in combat, whelmed with strife,
Strike for liberty and life!

Sons of Britain, ye know well
How the clarion trumpets swell
When, like some tempestuous star,
Flares the oriflamme of war!
If it summon you to strife
Strike for liberty and life!

Will ye bear the Teuton heel
Crushing down your Commonweal?
Will ye not avenge the wrong
Europe hath endured so long?
Stay the tyranny and strife,
Strike for liberty and life?

<pb n="82"/>
Hark! they mutter in their sleep,
All those heroes of the deep --
Nelson, Rodney, Hawkins, Drake,
All who fought for Britain's sake,
Fought and died that such as we
Might strike for life and liberty!

Ye, who answer Honour's call
To strive, to conquer, or to fall --
Ye who call yourselves the sons
Of Marlboroughs and Wellingtons --
Claim your heritage of strife,
Strike for liberty and life.

Straining upwards to the light,
Striving ever for the right,
Sons of Britain, dauntless stand
For God and King and Fatherland.
Join the battle, face the strife,
Strike for liberty and life!

THE SHIRKER
<note>[Suggested by Mr. Robert Blatchford's article in <hi rend="italic">The Daily Mail</hi>.]</note>

He moors the skiff within the cooler gloom
Of river-branches, unaware of doom;
Cushioned he lolls, and looks in faces fair,
Nursing with placid hand anointed hair.
It seems he scarcely can uplift the weight
Of summer afternoon, far less of fate.
So the young Briton, sprawling in his strength,
Supports a heavy Sabbath at full length,
Till sinks the sun on more than that sweet river,
Perhaps upon our day goes down for ever.
But though that orb may on an Empire set,
Tomlinson lights another cigarette.

GHOSTS AT BOULOGNE

One dreamer, when our English soldiers trod
But yesterday the welcoming fields of France,
Saw war-gaunt shadows gathering stare askance
Upon those levies and that alien sod --
Saw Churchill's smile, and Wellington's curt nod
Saw Harry with his Crispins, Chandos' lance
And the Edwards on whose breasts the leopards dance:
Then heard a gust of ghostly thanks to God
That the most famous quarrel of all time
In the most famous friendship ends at last;
Such flame of friendship as God fans to forge
A sword to strike the Dragon of the Slime,
Bidding St. Denis with St. George stand fast
Against the Worm. St. Denis and St. George!

TO THE BELGIANS
FROM ENGLAND

O men of mickle heart and little speech,
Slow, stubborn countrymen of heath and plain,
Now have ye shown these insolent again
That which to Cæsar's legions ye could teach,
That slow-provok'd is long-provok'd. May each
Crass Cæsar learn this of the Keltic grain,
Until at last they reckon it in vain
To browbeat us who hold the Western reach.
For even as you, so we are, ill to rouse,
Rooted in Custom, Order, Church and King;
And as you fight for their sake, so shall we,
Stubbornly, inch by inch, and house by house;
Seeing for us, too, there's a dearer thing
Than land or blood -- and that thing Liberty.

SONG OF THE SOLDIERS

What of the faith and fire within us
<l rend="indent4">Men who march away
<l rend="indent4">Ere the barn-cocks say
<l rend="indent4">Night is growing gray,
To hazards whence no tears can win us;
What of the faith and fire within us
<l rend="indent4">Men who march away?

Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
<l rend="indent4">Friend with the musing eye
<l rend="indent4">Who watch us stepping by,
<l rend="indent4">With doubt and dolorous sigh?
Can much pondering so hoodwink you!
Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
<l rend="indent4">Friend with the musing eye?

Nay. We see well what we are doing,
<l rend="indent4">Though some may not see --
<l rend="indent4">Dalliers as they be! --
<l rend="indent4">England's need are we; 
<pb n="90"/>
Her distress would leave us rueing:
Nay. We see well what we are doing,
<l rend="indent4">Though some may not see!

In our heart of hearts believing
<l rend="indent4">Victory crowns the just,
<l rend="indent4">And that braggarts must
<l rend="indent4">Surely bite the dust,
Press we to the field ungrieving,
In our heart of hearts believing
<l rend="indent4">Victory crowns the just.

Hence the faith and fire within us
<l rend="indent4">Men who march away
<l rend="indent4">Ere the barn-cocks say
<l rend="indent4">Night is growing gray,
To hazards whence no tears can win us;
Hence the faith and fire within us
<l rend="indent4">Men who march away.

THE BATTLE OF THE BIGHT

Had I the fabled herb
<l rend="indent">That brought to life the dead,
Whom would I dare disturb
<l rend="indent">In his eternal bed?
Great Grenville would I wake,
And with glad tidings make
The soul of mighty Drake
<l rend="indent">Heave up a glorying head.

As rose the misty sun,
<l rend="indent">Our men the North Sea scanned,
And each rejoicing gun
<l rend="indent">Welcomed a Foe at hand,
And thundering its delight,
Opened its mouth outright,
And bit them in the Bight,
<l rend="indent">The Bight of Helgoland.

<pb n="96"/>
With Captains who could each
<l rend="indent">Do aught but yield or flee;
With guns that spake the speech
<l rend="indent">Shall keep this Kingdom free;
We hammered to their doom
Four Giants mid the gloom,
And one to a fiercer tomb
<l rend="indent">Sent blazing down the sea.

Sleep on, O Drake, sleep well,
<l rend="indent">In days not wholly dire!
Grenville, whom nought could quell,
<l rend="indent">Unquenched is still thy fire.
And thou that hadst no peer,
Nelson! thou need'st not fear:
Thy sons and heirs are here,
<l rend="indent">Nor shall they shame their sire.
