POEMS OF THE GREAT WAR


WRITTEN ON SERVICE IN EGYPT
<ref target="[noteid]">1</ref>
<note id="[noteid]" place="foot" n="numberofmark">
When last heard from, the author, who is a British officer, was on service at Khartoum.</note>

Behind us in vermilion state 
The sun fell to the rustling sea, 
The grey-green twilight came and went, 
And night involved my friend and me.

Now Egypt donned her fairest robes 
Of glimmering moonshine cool and clear: 
No more we talked, and silently 
Made o'er the waste to Abu Qir.

For, with the twilight, twilight dreams 
Had come and borne our souls away, 
Though still our bodies onward fared 
Toward the palm-trees and the bay.

And my companion now, I think, 
With brother-artists once again 
Was painting in the atelier, 
Or down some dear Parisian lane

<pb n="2"/>
Was seeking with a motley throng 
That well-remembered brasserie, 
And Trilby, hanging on his arm, 
Was laughing at him merrily.

But I, ah, where was I? Afar 
I'd flown to that enchanted shore, 
Where o'er white-flashing waves the wind 
From Donegal to Mullaghmore 
Comes gallivanting bold and free -- 
INDENTGod grant again I there may be, 
INDENTAt Mullaghmore, with Rosalind.

WAR YAWP 

<l rend="italic">America! 
<l rend="italic">England's cheeky kid brother, 
<l rend="italic">Who bloodily assaulted your august elder 
<l rend="italic">At Bunker Hill and similar places 
<l rend="italic">(Not mentioned in our history books), 
<l rend="italic">What can I tell you of war or of peace? 
<l rend="italic">Say, have you forgotten 1861? 
<l rend="italic">Bull Run, Gettysburg, Fredericksburg? 
<l rend="italic">Your million dead? 
<l rend="italic">Tell me, 
<l rend="italic">Was that the greatest time of your lives 
<l rend="italic">Or the most disastrous? 
<l rend="italic">Who knows? Not you; not I. 
<l rend="italic">Who can tell the end of this war? 
<l rend="italic">And say, brother Jonathan, 
<l rend="italic">D'you know what it's all about? 
<l rend="italic">Let me whisper you a secret -- we don't! 
<l rend="italic">We were all too fat with peace, 
<l rend="italic">Or perhaps we didn't quite know how good peace was, 
<l rend="italic">And so here we are, 
<l rend="italic">And we're going to win....

It's fine to be a soldier, 
To get accepted by the recruiting sergeant,
<pb n="4"/>
Be trained, fitted with a uniform and a gun, 
Say good-bye to your girl, 
And go off to the front 
Whistling, "It's a long way to Tipperary." 
It's good to march forty miles a day, 
Carrying ninety-one pounds on your back, 
To eat good coarse food, get blistered, tired out, wounded, 
Thirst, starve, fight like a devil 
(<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, like you an' me, Jonathan), 
With the Maxims zip-zipping 
And the shrapnel squealing, 
And the howitzers rumbling like the traffic in Piccadilly.

Civilization? --
Jonathan, if you could hear them 
Whistling the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Marching Through Georgia</hi>, 
You'd want to go too. 
Twenty thousand a day, Jonathan! 
Perhaps you're more civilized just now than we are, 
Perhaps we've only forgotten civilization for a moment, 
Perhaps we're really fighting for peace. 
And after all it will be more fun afterwards -- 
More fun for the poets and the painters --
When the cheering's all over
<pb n="5"/>
And the dead men buried 
And the rest gone back to their jobs. 
It'll be more fun for them to make their patterns, 
Their word-patterns and color-patterns. 
And after all, there is always war and always peace, 
Always the war of the crowds, 
Always the great peace of the arts.

Even now, 
With the war beating in great waves overhead, 
Beating and roaring like great winds and mighty waters, 
The sea-gods still pattern the red seaweed fronds, 
Still chip the amber into neck-chains 
For Leucothea and Thetis. 
Even now, 
When the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> screams like a hurt woman, 
And Paris -- grisette among cities -- trembles with fear, 
The poets still make their music 
Which nobody listens to, 
Which hardly anyone ever listened to.

The great crowds go by, 
Fighting over each other's bodies in peace-time, 
Fighting over each other's bodies in war-time. 
Something of the strife comes to them 
In their little, high rock-citadel of art,
<pb n="6"/>
Where they hammer their dreams in gold and copper, 
Where they cut them in pine-wood, in Parian stone, in wax, 
Where they sing them in sweet bizarre words 
To the sound of antiquated shrill instruments; 
And they are happy.

The little rock-citadel of the artists 
Is always besieged; 
There, though they have beauty and silence, 
They have always tears and hunger and despair. 
But that little citadel has held out 
Against all the wars of the world 
Like England, brother Jonathan. 
It will not fall during the great war.

There is always war and always peace; 
Always the war of the crowds, 
Always the great peace of the arts. 
**1914.

A NEGLECTED GARDEN

Barren the garden lies, undressed; 
Long weeds like serpents coil and squeeze 
Forsaken loves of faithless bees, 
Boughs broken, to the ground are pressed; 
Columbines, heartsease, picotees 
No more greet evening from the West, 
Nor lilies give their beauty to the night --
Where are the roses of our lost delight?

Deep rooted, to the sun they glow 
In a new world's eternal Spring; 
Low at our feet the tendrils cling, 
High as the Himalayan snow 
The birds among their branches sing; 
From crag and strand and plain they grow, 
France, utmost Africa, the cold North Sea, 
Mesopotamia and Gallipoli.

Let the neglected garden lie 
There is no need for English flowers, 
These, by a right divine, are ours, 
These bloom forever under every sky, 
Droop in no drought, thirst for no showers,
<pb n="8"/>
These by no frosts of Autumn die, 
Immortal loveliness for the bleak years, 
Fed with our heart's blood, watered with our tears. 
##-- Eleanor Alexander.

YOUNG AND OLD

<hi rend="italic">Young.</hi>  What makes the dale so strange, my dear? 
<l rend="indent10">What makes the dale so strange?
<hi rend="italic">Old.</hi>    The men have gone from the dale, my dear, 
<l rend="indent10">And that makes all the change.

<hi rend="italic">Young.</hi>  The lanes and glens are still at night,
<l rend="indent10">No laughter or songs I hear.
<hi rend="italic">Old.</hi>    Our lover-lads have marched to the fight
<l rend="indent10">And maidens are lonely, my dear.

<hi rend="italic">Young.</hi>  The kine are slow to come to the call
<l rend="indent10">That once were all so quick.
<hi rend="italic">Old.</hi>    They miss the voice known best of all,
<l rend="indent10">Of John or brother Dick.

<hi rend="italic">Young.</hi>  And will the dale be always strange 
<l rend="indent10">And dull and sad, my dear?
<hi rend="italic">Old.</hi>    Ay, lassie, we shall feel the change
<l rend="indent10">For many a mournful year.

UNSER GOTT

They held a great prayer-service in Berlin, 
And augured German triumph from some words 
Said to be spoken by the Jewish God 
To Gideon, which signified that He 
Was staunchly partial to the Israelites. 
The aisles were thronged; and in the royal box 
(I had it from a tourist who was there, 
Clutching her passport, anxious, like the rest), 
There sat the Kaiser, looking "very sad." 
And then they sang; she said it shook the heart. 
The women sobbed; tears salted bearded lips 
Unheeded; and my friend looked back and saw 
A young girl crumple in her mother's arms. 
They carried out a score of them, she said, 
While German hearts, through bursting German throats 
Poured out, <hi rend="italic">Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott!</hi>

(Yea, "Unser Gott! Our strength is <hi rend="italic">Unser</hi> Gott!
Not that light-minded Bon Dieu of France!")

I think we all have made our God too small. 
There was a young man, a good while ago,
<pb n="12"/>
Who taught that doctrine... but they murdered him 
Because he wished to share the Jewish God 
With other folk.
<l rend="indent18">They are long-lived, these fierce 
Old hating Gods of nations; but at last 
There surely will be spilled enough of blood 
To drown them all! The deeps of sea and air, 
Of old the seat of gods, no more are safe, 
For mines and monoplanes. The Germans, now, 
Can surely find and rout the God of France 
With Zeppelins, or some slim mother's son 
Of Paris, or of Tours, or Brittany, 
Can drop a bomb into the <hi rend="italic">Feste Burg</hi>, 
And, having crushed the source of German strength, 
Die happy in his blazing monoplane.

Sad jesting! If there be no God at all, 
Save in the heart of man, why, even so --
Yea, all the more, -- since we must make our God, 
Oh, let us make Him large enough for all, 
Or cease to prate of Him! If kings must fight, 
Let them fight for their glory, openly, 
And plain men for their lands and for their homes, 
And heady youths, who go to see the fun, 
Blaspheme not God. True, maybe we might leave 
The God of Germany to some poor frau 
Who cannot go, who can but wait and mourn,
<pb n="13"/>
Except that she will teach Him to her sons --
A God quite scornful of the Slavic soul,
And much concerned to keep Alsace-Lorraine.
They should go godless, too -- the poor, benumbed
Crushed, anguished women, till their hearts can hold
A greater Comforter!

<l rend="indent22">(Yet it is hard
To make Him big enough! For me, I like
The English and the Germans and the French, 
The Russians, too; and Servians, I should think, 
Might well be very interesting to God. 
But, do the best I may, my God is white, 
And hardly takes a nigger seriously 
This side of Africa. Not those, at least 
Who steal my wood, and of a summer night 
Keep me awake with shouting, where they sit 
With monkey-like fidelity and glee 
Grinding through their well-oiled sausage-mill --
The dead machinery of the white man's church --
Raw jungle-fervor, mixed with scraps sucked dry 
Of Israel's old sublimities: not those. 
And when they threaten us, the Higher Race, 
Think you, which side is God's? Oh, let us pray 
Lest blood yet spurt to wash that black skin white, 
As now it flows because a German hates 
A Cossack, and an Austrian a Serb!)
<pb n="14"/>
What was it that he said so long ago, 
The young man who outgrew the Jewish God --
"Not a sparrow falleth --?" Ah, God, God, 
And there shall fall a million murdered men!
##-- Karle Wilson Baker.
