<l>INTRODUCTION</l>

<p>In the stress of a nation's peril some of its greatest songs are born. In the stress of a nation's peril the poet at last comes into his own again, and with clarion call he rouses the sleeping soul of the empire. Prophet he is, champion and consoler.</p>
<p>If in these later times the poet has been neglected, now in our infinite need, in our pride and our sorrow, he is here to strengthen, comfort and inspire. The poet is vindicated.</p>

<p>What can so nobly uplift the hearts of a people facing war with its unspeakable agony as music and poetry? The sound of martial music steels men's hearts before battle. The sound of martial words inspires human souls to do and to endure. God, His poetry, and His music are the Holy Trinity of war.</p>

<p>Not always the greatest songs that have sent men on to victory. Sometimes it has been a modest verse  that  has   found  refuge   in  the  heart   of   the

<pb n="vi INTRODUCTION"/>

soldier ready for the ultimate sacrifice, cheered on his way by the lilt of a humble song. Who else,indeed, can take the place of a poet ?</p>

<p>As Mr. William Watson has most nobly said :</p>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>" Empires dissolve and peoples disappear :</l>
<l>Song passes not away.</l>
<l>Captains and conquerors leave a little dust,</l>
<l>And kings a dubious legend of their reign ;</l>
<l>The swords of Caesars, they are less than rust:</l>
<l>The poet doth remain."</l></lg>

<l>PUBLISHER'S NOTE</l>

<p>Of our poets who have been inspired to write and publish separate volumes of war poems during the actual progress of a campaign, we can only recall one--the late Sydney Dobell, whose " Sonnets on the War," and " England in Time of War," both dealt with the Crimea. Mr. William Watson's "The Purple East" was read and quoted the world over during the Armenian atrocities : indeed, " Abdul the Damned " has passed into the language. Although this famous sonnet sequence sprang out of events which could not be called a campaign in the accepted and legitimate sense of the word, yet it may be fairly argued that the Kaiser has surpassed the Turk in inflicting suffering on defenceless people.</p>

<p>Doubtless, however, some of the many poets writing during the present war will in the course of time collect their verses and issue them as independent volumes.</p>



<pb n="viii                                  PUBLISHER'S NOTE"/>

<p>Anthologies also there are, without number, of poems of war on land and sea ; but none of these, so far as I can discover, has been formed during the conflict itself. In this respect, therefore, this collection is unique. I am proposing to issue a series of these volumes during the progress of this great war, dealing with its outstanding events. The next will include a number of poems that have appeared in American and Canadian papers, and will thus have a peculiar interest as expressing the feelings of our kinsmen beyond the sea. All the profits derived from the sale of these anthologies will be given to the Prince of Wales's Fund. Perhaps,therefore, in the event of similar collections being made, it would generally be well if the poet would prevent any possible overlapping by consenting to his poem's appearance in one collection only. In this way the public may be induced to buy the various collections rather than any particular one.</p>

<p>Viscount Dillon sends me the following, taken from <hi rend="italic">La France du Nord</hi> of August 23. These lines, by a poetic ally, who remains anonymous, are as correct in feeling as they are ingenious in adapting themselves to the rhythm of our own National Anthem.</p>

<l>How much a Kaiser's word is worth.</l>
<l>A Kaiser's word, a Caitiffs vow !</l>
<l>Well have we learned their value now.</l>

<l>Over the bland and kindly Day,</l>

<l>Unseasonable Night he flings;</l>
<l>Sinister darkness blear and grey,</l>

<l>A horror of malignant wings.</l>
<l>Pain and red havoc he bestows</l>
<l>On them that only asked repose.</l>

<l>He is not hungrier for your lands</l>

<l>Smite him with all your thunderous hands.</l>

<l>Fight him and smite him to his knees—</l>

<l>Shall guard the fortress of the world.</l>

<l>TO THE KING OF THE BELGIANS</l>

<l>Multitudes upon multitudes they throng</l>

<l>They bid the peoples tremble and obey:</l>
<l>Their faces are set forward, all for wrong.</l>
<l>They trample on the covenant and are strong</l>
<l>And terrible.    Who shall dare to say them nay ?</l>
<l>How shall a little nation bar the way</l>
<l>Where that resistless host is borne along ?</l>

<l>You never thought, O I gallant King, to bow</l>

<l>To overmastering force and stand aside.</l>

<l>Safe and secure you might have reigned.    But now</l>

<l>The Summer wanes : and, 'Erbert, in the haunts</l>

<l>That have been hallowed by your yearly favour</l>
<l>The " fag" that you affect no longer flaunts</l>

<l>Your bare but lustrous poll, your lurid ties.</l>

<l>The wond'rous garb you choose for your adorning</l>
<l>At Margate gladden no expectant eyes;</l>

<l>And Southend is in mourning.</l>

<l>The rail you used, in your adjacent park,</l>

<l>Whereon to perch, that girls might glance in</l>

<l>Disturb no more the matutinal travel ;</l>
<l>And "form"—you scarcely know which horse is which—</l>
<l>No longer you unravel.</l>

<l>You have been, more or less, an ornament,</l>

<l>Too precious for the strenuous endeavour</l>
<l>Of those on getting goals, or wickets, bent;</l>
<l>And not unduly clever.</l>

<l>We held you as a nuisance at your worst.</l>

<l>And at your best a useless sort of blighter,</l>
<l>Never imagining that you might burst.</l>
<l>Some day, into a fighter.</l>

<l>We've heard you call on God to save the King,</l>

<l>And shout the " Marseillaise "—somewhat shyly—</l>
<l>But, still, your martial ardour was a thing</l>
<l>We did not value highly.</l>

<l>Yet, in the altered circumstances, 'Erb,</l>

<l>We feel that in our world there's something</l>
<l>lacking—</l>

<l>My sea-winds I gather, my fields I fill</l>

<l>My sons I unite for my greatest fight</l>
<l>My dream and desire to gain.</l>

<l>My land I have clothed in its fairest garb.</l>

<l>I arise in my pride, once more to decide</l>
<l>In the conflict of false and true.</l>

<l>I summon to battle from plain and hill.</l>
<l>From woodland and fen and dale,</l>
<l>From my reeking towns and greyhound downs</l>
<l>My men to be cast in the scale.</l>

<l>My flesh still quivers.    The poisoned barb</l>

<l>My vision of peace and truth.</l>

<l>I have cleansed the seas, and have opened them</l>
<l>To traffic of many ships :</l>

<l>I would purge the land with the same firm hand</l>
<l>To let peace know no eclipse.</l>

<l>My dreams are challenged.    I make my stand.</l>
<l>My vision shall still prevail.</l>
<l>From my white tower I send my power</l>
<l>Arrayed in its proven mail.</l>

<l>No glory I covet, nor diadem.</l>

<l>Shaggy brows o'erhung and shaded</l>
<l>Eyes of cynical clairvoyance</l>

<l>Of the shivering, thrall-bound soul</l>

<l>Stone-blind to the far horizons</l>
<l>Of the aspiring human spirit:</l>
<l>Stone-blind to the dawning promise</l>
<l>Of a wiser, happier age.</l>

<l>You shared our griefs with seeming-gentle eyes ;</l>

<l>You moved among us cousinly entreated;</l>
<l>Still hiding, under that fair outward guise,</l>
<l>A heart that cheated.</l>

<l>And now the mask is down, and forth you stand</l>

<l>Known for a King whose word is no great matter,</l>
<l>A traitor proved, for every honest hand</l>
<l>To strike and shatter.</l>

<l>This was the " Day " foretold by yours and you</l>

<l>In whispers here, and there with beery clamours—</l>
<l>You and your rat-hole spies and blustering crew</l>
<l>Of loud Potsdamers.</l>

<l>TO WOMEN</l>

<l>Your hearts are lifted up, your hearts</l>
<l>That have foreknown the utter price.</l>
<l>Your hearts burn upward as a flame</l>
<l>Of splendour and of sacrifice.</l>

<l>For you, you too to battle go,</l>

<l>Not with the marching drums and cheers,</l>

<l>But in the watch of solitude</l>

<l>And through the boundless night of fears.</l>

<l>Swift, swifter than those hawks of war,</l>
<l>Those threatening wings that pulse the air,</l>
<l>Far as the vanward ranks are set,</l>
<l>You are gone before them, you are there !</l>

<l>And not a shot comes blind with death,</l>

<l>And not a stab of steel is pressed</l>

<l>Home, but invisibly it tore</l>

<l>And entered first a woman's breast.</l>

<l>TO WOMEN</l>

<l>Amid the thunder of the guns.</l>

<l>The lightning of the lance and sword.</l>

<l>Your hope, your dread, your throbbing pride,</l>

<l>Your infinite passion is outpoured</l>

<l>From hearts that are as one high heart</l>
<l>Withholding naught from doom and bale,</l>
<l>Burningly offered up—to bleed.</l>
<l>To bear, to break, but not to fail.</l>

<l>TOWARDS THE LIGHT</l>

<l>Once o'er those downs wild beacons blazed,</l>

<l>Weird messengers of fate and fight.</l>
<l>She was not wild, dismayed, or dazed.</l>

<l>But calmly looked towards the light—</l>
<l>Towards the light that springs from night.</l>

<l>As sure as courage springs from faith.</l>
<l>So now, when like some hideous wraith</l>

<l>War mocks, with bodings from the dead.</l>
<l>Our moonlit harvests, swathe on swathe,</l>

<l>May she, dear England, lift her head</l>
<l>Towards the light, towards the light—</l>
<l>Praying that God defend the right.</l>

<l>[Suggested by Mr. Robert Blatchford's article in</l>

<l>He moors the skiff within the cooler gloom</l>
<l>Of river-branches, unaware of doom ;</l>
<l>Cushioned he lolls, and looks in faces fair.</l>
<l>Nursing with placid hand anointed hair.</l>
<l>It seems he scarcely can uplift the weight</l>
<l>Of summer afternoon, far less of fate.</l>
<l>So the young Briton, sprawling in his strength.</l>
<l>Supports a heavy Sabbath at full length.</l>
<l>Till sinks the sun on more than that sweet river,</l>
<l>Perhaps upon our day goes down for ever.</l>
