<l>Our daughters flower in vernal grace;</l>
<l>In strength our striplings wax apace;</l>
<l>Our cities teem ; our commerce rides</l>
<l>Sovereign upon the fawning tides.</l>
<l>But while, to this our stronghold—where</l>
<l>The North Wind's wandering children fair,</l>
<l>Like wild birds from the waters sprung,</l>
<l>Built their wild nest and reared their young—</l>
<l>The fleets of peace for ever pour</l>
<l>Fruitage and vintage, gems and ore;</l>
<l>While here, within each ocean gate.</l>
<l>Long barricadoed against Fate,</l>
<l>We are served by all the alien seas.</l>
<l>And fed from the Antipodes,</l>

<pb n="14 RETROGRESSION"/>

<l>Lo, everywhere the unplenished brain!</l>
<l>Everywhere, dire as bondman's chain,</l>
<l>Or laws that crush, or creeds that blind,</l>
<l>The leanness of the unnourished mind.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>For few and fewer do they grow.</l>
<l>Who know, or ever cared to know,</l>
<l>The great things greatly said and sung</l>
<l>In this heroic English tongue.</l>
<l>This craggy speech, the rough-wrought key</l>
<l>To palaces of wizardry.</l>
<l>Our fathers' glory, and our despair;</l>
<l>And many a fabric hung in air.</l>
<l>That firmer stands than boastful stone;</l>
<l>And many a tower of vigil lone.</l>
<l>Whence Wisdom sees, beneath her curled,</l>
<l>The involved, inextricable world.</l>
</lg>

<pb n="15 RETROGRESSION"/>

<lg>
<l>And shouldst thou have in thee to-day</l>
<l>Aught thou canst better sing than say.</l>
<l>Shun, if thou wouldst by men be heard.</l>
<l>The comely phrase, the wellborn word.</l>
<l>And use, as for their ears more meet,</l>
<l>The loose-lipped lingo of the street,</l>
<l>A language Milton's kin have long</l>
<l>Accounted good enough for song.</l>
<l>Or don that vesture not less vile.</l>
<l>The beaded and bespangled style—</l>
<l>Diction o'erloaded and impure.</l>
<l>Thy thought lost in its garniture.</l>
<l>Till this itself becomes the goal.</l>
<l>The alpha, omega, and whole;</l>
<l>Thy Muse, ev'n to her raiment's hem,</l>
<l>Huddling uncostly gem on gem.</l>
<l>Striving her lax form to bestar</l>

<pb n="16 RETROGRESSION"/>

<l>With all crude ornaments that are;</l>
<l>An empty and a dreary strife,</l>
<l>Vulgar in Letters as in Life.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Nor look for praise, save here and there</l>
<l>From a fast-dwindling remnant rare.</l>
<l>If thou beget with happy pain</l>
<l>The ordered and the governed strain</l>
<l>That peradventure had not shamed</l>
<l>Masters felicitously famed,</l>
<l>Dryden, the athlete large and strong,</l>
<l>Lord of the nerve and sinew of song;</l>
<l>The easeful victor, who subdued</l>
<l>Till conquest was but habitude;</l>
<l>A hewer and shaper who could see</l>
<l>In adamant plasticity,</l>
<l>Who tore from the entrails of the mine</l>

<pb n="17 RETROGRESSION"/>

<l>The metal of his iron line—</l>
<l>Iron that oft all molten rolled.</l>
<l>Heaved to a billow, and crashed to gold,</l>
<l>Who, born beside the haughty tomb</l>
<l>Of that rank time of overbloom</l>
<l>When poets vied in gathering each</l>
<l>Full-bosomed apple and buxom peach</l>
<l>That odorous in the orchard burned,</l>
<l>Had, from their purple surfeit, leamed</l>
<l>The truth in Hellas seen so plain.</l>
<l>That the art of arts is to refrain;—</l>
<l>Or Gray, who on worn thoughts conferred</l>
<l>That second youth, the perfect word,</l>
<l>The elected and predestined phrase</l>
<l>That had lain bound, long nights and days,</l>
<l>To wear at last, when once set free,</l>
<l>Immortal pellucidity;</l>

<pb n="18 RETROGRESSION"/>

<l>And who, in that most mighty Ode,</l>
<l>That like a pageant streamed and glowed,</l>
<l>Called up anew mid breathing things</l>
<l>The great ghosts of our tragic Kings,</l>
<l>With doom-dark brows to come and go,</l>
<l>Trailing the folds of gorgeous woe.</l>

<lg>
<l>WHEN, as of old in Rome's imperial world,</l>
<l>Fair, conquered gods are from their temples</l>
<l>hurled,</l>
<l>And some rude, vehement Peter puts to flight</l>
<l>Some serene Phœbus, lord of lore and light,</l>
<l>In wastes and wilds, by fount and caverned hill,</l>
<l>Secretly, furtively, are worshipped still.</l>
<l>With the sad zeal of vainly pious knees,</l>
<l>The ancient, the deposed divinities,</l>
<l>Heaven's outcasts, the great exiles of the sky.</l>
<l>Once mighty to do all things, save to die.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>So, though in kingdoms of the Lyre to-day</l>
<l>I see the new faiths push the old away—</l>
<pb n="20 THE MOSSGROWN PORCHES"/>
<l>See the hot hierophants of each strange shrine</l>
<l>Offer oblation to all gods but mine,</l>
<l>And proudliest build their sanctuary and home</l>
<l>Where broods, on England's Tiber, England's</l>
<l>Rome;</l>
<l>Yet, mid a revel of change, unchanged I turn</l>
<l>To the lorn haunts where older altars burn,—</l>
<l>There seek, companioned by the lessening few</l>
<l>Whose faith is as mine own, the gods I knew;</l>
<l>Seek in deep clefts, and hushed in forests find,</l>
<l>The far-withdrawn Olympians of the mind,</l>
<l>Nor ever doubt, that among wondering men</l>
<l>These deathless will in triumph come again,</l>
<l>As sure as the droop'd year's remounting curve,</l>
<l>And reign anew, when I no more shall serve.</l>

<l>A pair of boots to buy.</l>
<l>Upon the morrow morn those boots</l>
<l>Let in the rain and sky.</l>

<lg>
<l>Then to the bootman I returned,</l>

<l>"'Tis true," quoth he, "the boots you bought</l>

<l>Not made for such ignoble ends</l>
<l>As vulgar use and wear.</l>

<lg>
<l>"Rather have they been fashioned forth</l>
<l>By one who did disdain</l>

<l>A boot that sets no bars</l>
<l>To the free ingress of the heavens</l>

<l>For which the ages yearned.</l>

<l>"His baffled flight, his broken wing.</l>
<l>His heart-cry and his pain.</l>
<l>Are worth a million perfect boots</l>
<l>That will keep out the rain."</l>

<l>Thy soul to Ireland sail away</l>

<l>Ah, little flower! in Irish ground</l>
<l>Thy roots are deeper than the sea,</l>
<l>Though English woodlands murmured round</l>
<l>The house of thy nativity.</l>

<l>Of both these peoples thou wert born,</l>
<l>Of both these lands thou art the child;</l>

<l>I pen to you across the brine;</l>
<l>This somewhat overdue epistle,</l>

<l>To speed at daybreak, west by south,</l>
<l>From lean Loch Ryan's snarling mouth,</l>
</lg>

<l>The least "disthressful" land on earth.</l>

<l>Three Olivers before your time</l>

<l>One was the paladin—or pal—</l>

<l>And one gave Drogheda to pillage,</l>
<l>And one wrote "The Deserted Village";</l>
<l>But sorra an Oliver ever seen</l>
<l>Compares with him of Stephen's Green,</l>
<l>And from this frosty, fiery North</l>
<l>I hail you Oliver the Fourth.</l>
<l>How goes it yonder? Very soon</l>
<l>St. Patrick's bell will toll Night's noon,</l>

<l>Be gazing down with bibulous leer</l>

<l>But ere I sleep, one wakeful word</l>
<l>Clamours to be no more deferred</l>
<l>When, when, I pray you, shall we twain</l>
<l>Forgather to discourse again</l>
<l>Of things the world holds cheap, and we</l>
<l>Rate above rubies? If the sea</l>
<l>And sky in their most iron mood</l>
<l>Daunt not at all your hardihood,</l>
<l>What of adventuring hither, while</l>
<l>Throughout this blanched and shivering isle</l>
<l>The Heav'ns grip fast as in a vice</l>
<l>The Earth's hands manacled with ice,</l>
<l>And drop not even a frozen tear</l>
<l>On the cold deathbed of the Year?</l>
<l>Our talk shall not be all of trenches,</l>
<l>Falkenhayn's strategy, or French's</l>
</lg>

<pb n="97 A FAMILIAR EPISTLE"/>

<l>Rather of matters built to abide</l>
<l>When the last din of war has died;</l>
<l>Art, Thought, and Song—the unageing themes—</l>
<l>And those sole verities, our dreams.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>But come or not, whichever suit you,</l>
<l>The Muse shall cordially salute you,</l>
<l>For Irishman with heart more true</l>
<l>Ne'er claimed descent from Brian Borru,</l>
<l>(Which sons of Erin mostly do)—</l>
<l>Nor ever in the days of old,</l>
<l>When Malachy wore the collar of gold,</l>
<l>Or Ulster parried Munster's blows</l>
<l>While Leinster pummelled Connaught's nose,</l>
<l>Lived the full life of feast and fast,</l>
<l>And found it goodly to the last.</l>
<l>Thus vows, with attestation fervent,</l>
</lg>

<l>Your faithful friend—a fellow servant</l>
