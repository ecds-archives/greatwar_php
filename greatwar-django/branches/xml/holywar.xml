<l rend="indent">Good stuff for soldiering, no doubt;</l>
<l>Troublesome when the drink was in,</l>
<l rend="indent">A quiet lad when it was out.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Too fond of gaming and the girls,</l>
<l rend="indent">And given to "language" that would fright</l>
<l>His mother dreaming of his curls</l>
<l rend="indent">And his soft boyish ways at night.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He had forgotten how to pray</l>
<l rend="indent">The way she taught him at her knees.</l>
<l>Her prayers ran like a river all day,</l>
<l rend="indent">And while she slept gave little ease.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The Calvary, by Souchez, holds</l>
<l rend="indent">Wide arms to clasp the new-made beds,</l>
<l>Where lie, nor toss their browns and golds,</l>
<l rend="indent">The precious, the beloved heads.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="10"/>
<l>Flynn's Captain, who had proved a friend</l>
<l rend="indent">At times a friend is needed most,</l>
<l>Slept there, and comfort was at end</l>
<l rend="indent">Because Flynn's faithful friend was lost.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>"Gassed." O'er that twisted grace and dumb,</l>
<l rend="indent">Flynn swore a choking oath to give</l>
<l>No quarter when the day should come</l>
<l rend="indent">And fed his hate to thrive and live.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Lest that his Captain feel forgot,</l>
<l rend="indent">At night when all the trenches slept,</l>
<l>Flynn tended like a garden plot</l>
<l rend="indent">The grave o'er which the night-dews wept.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He raised a little cross of sticks,</l>
<l rend="indent">Pansies, forget-me-nots, amid;</l>
<l>Over him the gaunt Crucifix</l>
<l rend="indent">Shed comfort -- or he thought it did.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Rank disobedience! No one knew</l>
<l rend="indent">How Flynn, so devil-may-care and brave,</l>
<l>Courted destruction just to do</l>
<l rend="indent">A little gardening on a grave.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="11"/>
<l>One night the shells lit all the dark,</l>
<l rend="indent">Burst in a million splinters of flame;</l>
<l>At morn, before the singing lark,</l>
<l rend="indent">Flynn to his tender office came.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>He smoothed the clay where it was rough,</l>
<l rend="indent">With his hard tender hand he drew</l>
<l>As 'twere a quilt of silken stuff</l>
<l rend="indent">Between the sleeper and the dew.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>All done, he stretched his six foot four,</l>
<l rend="indent">And yawning, in the dawn's pale glow,</l>
<l>Bent to the Crucifix once more,</l>
<l rend="indent">Saluted ere he turned to go.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Then here's the marvel -- the dead Christ</l>
<l rend="indent">Opened His Eyes, the very Eyes</l>
<l>That Mary loved, which through a mist</l>
<l rend="indent">The saved souls see in Paradise.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>Flynn, like Elijah, caught to Heaven!</l>
<l rend="indent">Plain Private Flynn -- saw God revealed!</l>
<l>Unto a simple soldier given</l>
<l rend="indent">The secret heart of Heaven unsealed.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="12"/>
<l>Could he go back to common joys</l>
<l rend="indent">After the joys of Heaven were won?</l>
<l>The quietness was rent with noise,</l>
<l rend="indent">The death sprang from the hidden gun.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>They shot Flynn's eyes out. That was good.</l>
<l rend="indent">Eyes that saw God are better blind.</l>
<l>Flynn muses on beatitude,</l>
<l rend="indent">His empty eye-sockets behind.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>In a bare London hospital ward</l>
<l rend="indent">He smiles and prays the live-long day.</l>
<l>He who has seen the living Lord</l>
<l rend="indent">Has Light upon the darkest way.</l></lg>

<l>Black London trees have made their screen</l>

<lg>
<l>And when she sleeps at last perchance</l>
<l rend="indent">Her soul hath slipped away</l>
<l>To fields of Serbia and of France</l>
<l rend="indent">Until the dawn of day.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>She wanders by the still moonbeam</l>
<l rend="indent">By dying and by dead,</l>
<l>And many a broken man will dream</l>
<l rend="indent">An angel lifts his head.</l></lg>

<lg>
<pb n="23"/>
<l>All day and night as a sweet smoke</l>
<l rend="indent">Her prayer ascends the skies</l>
<l>That all her piteous fighting folk</l>
<l rend="indent">May walk in Paradise.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>And still her innocent pulses stir,</l>
<l rend="indent">Her heart is proud and high,</l>
