<l n="1">I LOVED you in Babylon.</l>
<l>Sweet Heart! you were a dancer then</l>
<l>And I watched where your little feet</l>
<l>Just stirred the dust within the market-place.</l>
<l>You passed me slow and down the sunlit street,</l>
<l>I saw the longing in the eyes of men</l>
<pb n="3O"/>
<l>Who caught the smile which glorified your face.</l>
<l>A moment -- little heart! --  and you were gone;</l>
<l>But where you passed -- you knew it not --</l>
<l>I marked and kissed the spot.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I loved you in royal Rome.</l>
<l>Sweet Heart! you were a vestal there</l>
<l>And I came to offer my gift.</l>
<l>A poor slave with a pigeon dearly bought,</l>
<l>Its feathers purer than snow's whitest drift.</l>
<l>With fevered soul I made my silent prayer</l>
<l>Though I could never touch the bliss I sought,</l>
<l>While holy Vesta's temple was your home.</l>
<l>A feather fell -- how should you see? --</l>
<l>Till death it stayed with me.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>I love you in London town.</l>
<l>Sweet Heart! you are a princess now</l>
<l>And the blue blood runs in your veins;</l>
<l>While I, alas! am but of common birth</l>
<l>Whom war is splashing with its crimson stains.</l>
<l>A soldier who has taken Honour's vow</l>
<l>To share the grandest task on God's wide earth.</l>
<l>One night you wore red roses in your gown.</l>
<l>A petal dropped -- you never guessed --</l>
<l>I hid it in my breast.</l></lg>

<pb n="31"/>
<lg>
<l>So shall I still love on.</l>
<l>Sweet Heart! your soul was close to me</l>
<l>When the world's first dreams were made.</l>
<l>We two were whispering love at God's own side</l>
<l>Or ever sunlight on the mountains played.</l>
<l>And through a wilderness of worlds I see</l>
<l>A time when reunited we shall glide</l>
<l>Unto the Soul of souls, the Perfect One.</l>
<l>Pass, life or lives! you'll understand</l>
<l>When Love gives me your hand.</l></lg>

<l>Of some forgotten glory. By the way,</l>
<l>Outlined in black against the sky, there stands</l>
<l>A wayside crucifix among the corn;</l>
<l>Waiting with tired eyes and outstretched hands</l>
<l>In patient expectation of the morn.</l></lg>

<lg>
<l>The gentle whisper of the poplar trees</l>
<l>Is hardly loud enough to break the spell</l>
<l>Of mystic silence. From the church tower's height</l>
<l>Comes, wafted onward by the dying breeze,</l>
<l>The solemn tolling of a single bell;</l>
<l>Then silence and the mystery of night.</l></lg>

<l>Oft in the tavern parlour I would sing</l>
<l rend="indent">Of morning sun upon the mountain vine,</l>

<l>I played with all the toys the gods provide,</l>
<l rend="indent">I sang my songs and made glad holiday.</l>
